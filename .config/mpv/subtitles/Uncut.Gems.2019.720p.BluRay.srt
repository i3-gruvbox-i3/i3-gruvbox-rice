1
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,950
Now reaching the right side
of the colon.

2
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,675
That looks pretty clean.

3
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,950
And there's the ileocecal valve,
which is patent. It looks fine.

4
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,235
The prep looks good.

5
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,352
It looks like he's well cleaned out.

6
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,233
Going up the sigmoid colon.

7
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,152
A few scattered diverticula there.

8
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,792
Heading towards the splenic flexure now.

9
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,229
That looks clean.

10
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,313
In the mid-transverse colon.

11
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,400
Wait a second.

12
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,517
That looks like a flat polyp there.

13
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,480
Probably about 2 cm.

14
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,712
We can take some biopsies of that.

15
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,914
Yussi, I'm a block away.

16
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,593
<i>Where the fuck are you, man?</i>

17
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,256
- I told you. I'm walking.
<i>- I've got two guys.</i>

18
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,936
<i>They said they're gonna be
watching the business the whole day.</i>

19
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,000
<i>What the fuck is going on?</i>

20
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,096
Hey, man, who the fuck
do you think you're talking to?

21
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,918
<i>They keep saying
they're friends of Arno.</i>

22
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,593
Arno? Tell them I'm coming up now.

23
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,040
Harvey, I need that.

24
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,355
Thirty inches.

25
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,112
That's, like, about 35 carats in there.

26
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,473
It's a SI1, VS2.

27
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,560
It's a white gold.

28
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,200
- And then right in the middle...
- Did you hear that shit?

29
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,640
- Yo, Howard. What's popping, man?
- Hi.

30
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,760
This is my nigga, Ca$h Out,
I was telling you about.

31
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,200
Yeah, man. That nigga cash it out.

32
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,232
- How do you feel? All right?
- No, it's good.

33
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,676
They're calling me with the results.

34
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,989
Hi. How are you?

35
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,719
- I'm good, man.
- Congratulations.

36
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,514
So we promise, man,
to come spend some money with you.

37
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,759
No, he's doing you a favor.

38
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,116
Believe me. That guy is a fucking moron.

39
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,510
Arno's friend is here? Yeah, I'm...

40
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,194
Yussi told me you were waiting on me,
so I'm sorry about that.

41
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,640
- I'm Howard.
- Phil.

42
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,791
You didn't bring him any water?

43
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,952
I'm good on the water.
I don't need any water. Thank you anyway.

44
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,033
This is our own spring water.

45
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,516
We're the first on the block to have that.

46
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,870
- Your parents happy for you?
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

47
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,998
All right. So I gotta tell you,
I'm in a bit of a rush.

48
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,316
I don't have much time because I gotta...

49
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,656
- What did I tell you?
- Hey.

50
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,559
I said no water.
Didn't I tell you no water?

51
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,390
I think it's in your best interest
that you find some time for you and I.

52
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,656
We're right on
the same page, right?

53
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,955
Yeah, we're on the same page.

54
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,200
- You all right, homie?
- Oh, yeah, 100% fine.

55
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,158
It's good. I'll handle it. I'll handle it.

56
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,360
- We don't do that here, sir.
- You're right.

57
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,080
<i>- Arno Meradian... is not available.</i>
- He's not answering.

58
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,456
He knows you're calling.
He doesn't want to deal with you anymore.

59
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,800
- I understand. Give me one second.
- I don't think you do.

60
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,389
It's not a fucking soap opera.
Listen. Enough.

61
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,880
- Don't move.
- What are we doing?

62
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,936
- What the fuck is...
- There you go again. Stop fighting me.

63
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,112
- This is not necessary.
- It isn't? We'll be the judge of that.

64
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,592
- What the fuck is this?
- The last of my mom's cash that I had.

65
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,876
- What about this? What's this?
- This is not mine.

66
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,576
- It's not mine.
- Take the fucking watch.

67
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,717
Take the fucking watch. Take it.

68
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,399
Fucking mutt.

69
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,634
<i>Arno Meradian... is not available.</i>

70
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,155
Arno, what the fuck is this shit?

71
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,199
You're sending collectors
to fuck with me at my office?

72
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,317
Are you out of your fucking mind?

73
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,314
I'm literally minutes away from closing
the biggest deal of my goddamn life,

74
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,676
and when I do,
you're gonna be embarrassed.

75
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,320
And by the way,
the watch they took from me,

76
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,596
it's worth $20,000.

77
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,036
I want that deducted
from the hundred grand.

78
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,554
You understand? Call me back!

79
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,675
Look at this.

80
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,274
What's up, ladies?

81
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,759
- Shh. She's sleeping.
- She's sleeping.

82
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,954
This is bullshit.

83
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,440
- Hey, Howie.
- How are you?

84
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,512
People coming in and out of the apartment.

85
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,872
- Oh, my God. Not this.
- You show up to work any time you please.

86
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,216
- Howard, I was working all night.
- I'm sick of this shit.

87
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,833
You're taking advantage of me.

88
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,280
Oh, my God. Howard.

89
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,830
10:30. It's time to wake up.

90
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,879
- You're so extra.
- So, you had a party last night?

91
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,031
I did not have a party.
Did we have a party?

92
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,356
- That was not a party.
- Why didn't you call me?

93
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,234
I did call you, at around 9:30.

94
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,993
You said, "I'll call you back in five."

95
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,096
- I waited for hours.
- Yes, because I fell asleep.

96
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,040
- No, that's rude.
- I was putting Beni to sleep.

97
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,713
Here we go with the lies.

98
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,440
- I'm not lying!
- You're so manipulative!

99
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,280
I had to fall asleep on the floor again!
I'm exhausted!

100
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,080
Well, I didn't ask you to have kids!
It's not my fault you have kids.

101
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,152
Shut the fuck up with that.

102
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,280
Do you wanna fucking stay mad
or get in bed and cuddle?

103
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,976
I know you want to cuddle, Howard.
Just come here.

104
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,878
- Come on, Howie.
- Come on. Just come here.

105
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,240
- Come on.
- Come here, baby.

106
00:09:44,241 --> 00:09:45,993
- Come on, Howie.
- Come on, Howie.

107
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,760
Come on.
I know you wanna come here, Howie.

108
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,117
- I'm so goddamn stressed out.
- I know you can't resist me.

109
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,630
I know you can't... Come and kiss me.

110
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,756
Come on.

111
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,514
Don't. Don't. You can't just do that.

112
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,751
Just give me a kiss. One kiss.

113
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,309
- Don't you wanna see the photos I took?
- Yes. Show me.

114
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,353
- What was this shoot?
- I took these pictures.

115
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,600
I think I have a future in...

116
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,800
- How much did you get?
- Thirty-five hundred.

117
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,256
- And who is this guy?
- It's this guy, The Weeknd.

118
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,919
What the fuck is The Weeknd?

119
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,037
He's gonna be major
even though he's from Canada.

120
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,634
This guy looks stupid.

121
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,976
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

122
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,356
Howard Ratner. How are you?
Great to see you.

123
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,877
I have a piece.
You know this kid, The Weeknd?

124
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,798
That's Michael JJackson there on the cross.

125
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,271
Gonna be a controversial piece.
It makes it more valuable.

126
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,397
The blacks are VS2s. That's platinum.

127
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,156
Turn around. Don't even...
Don't even step in my place. Turn around.

128
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,816
I got some bets. Twenty-four G's.

129
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,877
Where would you get 24 G's?

130
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,715
I want the OKC-Lakers.
I want the fucking over. All right?

131
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,200
- I want Kobe's under.
- Kobe under.

132
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,593
Because all of a sudden, he's passing.

133
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,313
He's not scoring tonight.

134
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,557
I want the Sixers to cover.

135
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,680
- Plus one.
- The points...

136
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,156
Let's finish the bet here.
Hey, one thing at a time.

137
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,033
This guy's... Come on now.

138
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,440
- <i>Yo.</i>
- Demany. Demany.

139
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,816
<i>- KG said you're gonna be here any minute.</i>
- Can you finish the bet?

140
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,480
If he gets to the store before I do,
keep him there.

141
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,960
<i>- Better get here soon, motherfucker.</i>
- Okay? You promise me?

142
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,280
Kevin Garnett is coming to
my fucking showroom right now. Right now.

143
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,359
<i>Eighth floor, going up.</i>

144
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,656
We've got every right
to fucking be here!

145
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,239
Here's the fucking owner. Fuck you!

146
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,115
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

147
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,833
Get the fuck out!

148
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,037
Get out. Get the fuck out!

149
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,040
Calm...

150
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,256
- What?
- Fuck you, man.

151
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,376
Everyone calm down.

152
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,896
You just got involved
in something you shouldn't have.

153
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,479
What the fuck is going on out here?

154
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,000
It's on you, asshole.

155
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,390
- You see this?
- I don't know these fucking guys.

156
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,119
You're dead, fucker. You're dead.

157
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,833
You think I'm playing games?

158
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,680
- Get your laugh off now, asshole.
- I didn't do nothing.

159
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,310
When I'm shoveling dirt over your head,
you'll see how funny it is then.

160
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,756
I have clients in the office.
This is crazy.

161
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,516
- Turn around and walk away.
- We're good. David, go back inside.

162
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,592
- Everything's fine.
- Turn around and walk away.

163
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,876
- That's my shop.
- Everybody back in there.

164
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,429
- Hello. Open the door.
- Get back in. Let's go.

165
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,591
Okay. Jesus. Fuck.

166
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,750
You're with KG?

167
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,592
Okay. Well, you gotta shut that door.

168
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,000
That's KG, huh?

169
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,592
Is that closed? Closed.

170
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,832
Howard. Howard.
What the fuck is going on, man?

171
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,197
They tried to fuck Yussi up.
Look at his fucking shirt.

172
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,720
- Look at his shirt.
- Okay.

173
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,074
Listen. Hey.
Thanks for the security, by the way.

174
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,279
Send those bitches back
to Paramus or Bay Ridge, yeah.

175
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,437
Will you take that
and charge it up for me?

176
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,274
All I got is fucking Yussi to protect me.

177
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,956
Hey, let us talk.

178
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,872
- What's up? What's up?
- What's going on?

179
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,838
Did Amar'e have fucking time on the clock?

180
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,470
- There was no time on the clock.
- Come on. You were waving him off.

181
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,136
I like the earrings.

182
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,879
- Like these?
- Those are great.

183
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,032
- When's the last time you cleaned them?
- What are you talking about?

184
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,358
- He could clean them real quick.
- Let me throw them in the ultrasonic.

185
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,591
- What's this gonna cost me?
- For free.

186
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,399
Free? For real?

187
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,713
I would think you'd have bigger rocks
than that just 'cause you're a big guy.

188
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,200
Let me see what you got.

189
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,296
Who would win in a fight,
Ben Wallace or Tony Allen?

190
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,676
- TA all day.
- Oh, yeah? Okay.

191
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,956
- What is that?
- Fuck out of here.

192
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,750
What is that, a gremlin?
See the iced-out gremlin over here?

193
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,590
Bring in a little fucking animal
or some kind of fucking toy or some shit,

194
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,478
and he'll just bling the bitch out.

195
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,195
I used to work with niggas
on early music videos.

196
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,336
- He's the first nigga to start all that.
- Are you serious?

197
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,478
- I started that shit.
- Show him the fucking eye.

198
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,200
All right.
So I did this, so it fucks with you.

199
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,352
- You serious?
- There it is.

200
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,679
It scares the shit out of people.

201
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,376
Fucking older model,
but it's dope.

202
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,470
Listen.

203
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,234
The shit was slamming. Slamming.

204
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,073
- What's the length on that?
- All right.

205
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,200
- Let me see the chain on that.
- That's an 18. I can get you a 14.

206
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,880
KG! Doc know you're here,
by the way?

207
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,236
No, he doesn't.
And let's keep it that way. All right?

208
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,875
It's game night.
You should be stretching out.

209
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,077
- What is he, your coach?
- No. He's just a fucking crazy-ass JJew.

210
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,616
- Throw these in the ultrasonic.
- Yes, boss.

211
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,791
- As soon as the other stuff is done.
- No, now.

212
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,190
KG, I wouldn't lean on that.

213
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,296
Kevin was just telling me
he's looking for some watches.

214
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,993
- Are you looking for watches?
- Uh-huh.

215
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,157
Let's go to the wall
of watches right here.

216
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,720
What are we talking? AP?

217
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,352
I was thinking about the Presi though,
the one you got that crazy-ass deal for.

218
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,480
That one for 16.

219
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,117
The crazy one though. You know?

220
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,556
- Yeah. The...
- The Presi.

221
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,074
- Yeah. Right. Right.
- Yeah.

222
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,196
Look at this.

223
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,909
Boom.

224
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,759
That's a small watch for a big man.

225
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,150
- Look at the detail in there.
- Yeah.

226
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,216
- You got papers for this?
- No.

227
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,755
- Of course he got papers.
- I don't have the box and papers.

228
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,399
I don't have either one.

229
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,751
- You sold me the shit, dummy.
- I don't remember that.

230
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,878
Listen, man.
Niggas call niggas out for this, man.

231
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,920
Of course.
If you don't have the box and paper...

232
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,271
You find me one nigga
with a KMH watch they called out.

233
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,036
It's a moot point, Demany,
because I don't have these. All right?

234
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,113
So, how about we move on
to the diamonds here?

235
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,312
Listen. You got a girl?
Why don't you get your girl a treat.

236
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,113
He doesn't have a girlfriend.

237
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,032
- Says who?
- Says you.

238
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,776
How you know if I got a girlfriend or not?

239
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,896
Howard, get the fuck over here.

240
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,389
- Because you told me.
- I never said that.

241
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,233
- The fuck are you doing?
- What's up?

242
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,936
Why didn't you bring
my goddamn watches out?

243
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,270
- I'm not doing that.
- The nigga would have bought one.

244
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,591
I told you, you can keep them in my safe.

245
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,496
I don't want you selling them
out of my showroom.

246
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,239
- You understand me?
- Fucking dumb-ass.

247
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,716
Where am I going to sell them?
On the goddamn street?

248
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,918
- That's not my problem, man.
- That ain't your fucking problem?

249
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,595
He don't like shit
in this dusty, tinfoil-filled bitch.

250
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,016
He's having a fucking ball here.
What are you talking about?

251
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,794
What the fuck is he gonna buy?
A goddamn Furby, nigga?

252
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,518
Fuck you. I'm gonna take his ass
to motherfucking Flawless.

253
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,576
- I'm not fucking with you today.
- You're not taking him to Flawless.

254
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,616
I'm taking him to Flawless,
since you're acting like a fucking...

255
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,394
KG, do me a favor.
Don't lean on that, please.

256
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,399
- You're acting stupid.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Okay.

257
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,352
Buzz them in now. Now.

258
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,352
Oh, my God. Is this...

259
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,199
This is it! This is it!

260
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,595
- Hey.
- What's up?

261
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,400
- Okay, look at this.
- Got a package from Fishtonic.

262
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,920
Bring it in. Go to my office.

263
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,356
KG, don't you dare leave, okay?

264
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,592
What's in this package
is gonna blow your mind, KG.

265
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,399
- Is it heavy?
- Yes.

266
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,314
Yes. Yes. Yes. Oh, my God.

267
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,919
- Right here.
- Give me that.

268
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,272
- Man, I can't do this anymore, bro.
- What happened?

269
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,194
What happened? Your street goons
in there, they attacked me, man.

270
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,033
What did you say
to piss them off?

271
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,918
Listen, Garnett's crew came in here.

272
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,117
They took a look around.
They see these guys.

273
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,351
They're like, "Who works here?
Who doesn't, get out."

274
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,856
I said, "These guys don't work here."

275
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,997
Well, that was stupid.
You shouldn't have said that.

276
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,816
These guys grabbed me.
They dragged me over the counter.

277
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,336
They ripped my shirt.
They got me looking like a fool over here.

278
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,717
Take this shirt. That's a Gucci shirt.
It's $500. It's brand-new.

279
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,316
Are you fucking serious right now?
It ain't about the shirt.

280
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,472
I gave you eight years of my life.
Look how you're treating me, man.

281
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,592
I put in everything into this business.

282
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,911
Saved your ass a thousand times.

283
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,957
I can't take this place anymore, man.

284
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,475
I can't deal with your problems
every other day.

285
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,110
There's a lot of people on this block
that would love to do business with me.

286
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,256
You're gonna see me out there working
with them, you're not gonna like it, man.

287
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,555
You're gonna be jealous.

288
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,071
You're not gonna like it, Howard.

289
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,710
Howard. Hello?

290
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,034
I'm standing here, man.

291
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,056
There's a lot of people I could be doing
business with other than you, Howard.

292
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,320
You're falling apart. You're looking like
a fool out here in the diamond district.

293
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,639
Looking through fucking fish?

294
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,639
I gave you eight years of my life,
and you can't even fucking talk to me

295
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,997
and look me in the eyes,
man-to-fucking-man?

296
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,555
Holy shit, I'm gonna come.

297
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,073
Man, fuck you, man.
I'm finished with this shit-hole.

298
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,556
KG. KG.

299
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,676
Yussi is gone. Gone for good.

300
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,877
Let me get a phone from you.

301
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,873
KG, you gotta come here. All right?
I gotta show you something.

302
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,032
- I gotta leave soon, man.
- I know, but listen to me.

303
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,670
Okay, so I'm watching TV,
like a year ago. All right?

304
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,116
I'm watching one of those
fucking History Channel shows,

305
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,635
trying to learn shit, and I stumble...

306
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,518
You ever hear of African JJews?

307
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,199
- African Jews?
- Yeah.

308
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,040
- No. All right? No.
- Nigga want everybody to be a Jew.

309
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,516
Check this out. All right?

310
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,597
So, these are black Jews. All right?

311
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,831
They're stranded
in the middle of Ethiopia.

312
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,073
- It's deep shit.
- Stranded?

313
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,830
Yeah. Look. They've got nothing.
They don't got cars. They don't got shit.

314
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,192
And I'm watching this, and I'm like,
"What the fuck are these guys wearing?"

315
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,631
It's on the Torah there.
It's everywhere. Right?

316
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,237
Where do these fucking guys get
precious black opals? That's what that is.

317
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,999
- Black opals?
- I do my research.

318
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,630
These guys live near the Welo mines,
which primarily is red opals,

319
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,837
which aren't worth shit, okay?

320
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,038
But these, you can't get your hands
on these things.

321
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,296
- You understand?
- Really?

322
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,040
So I say to myself,
"How do I get ahold of these guys?"

323
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,040
And I managed to track these guys down
and I buy one from him.

324
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,634
Holy shit.

325
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,559
What is that?
It's right here. That's the rock.

326
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,200
That's the rock. That's the stone.
I got this.

327
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,816
Look how this is winking
in the light.

328
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,069
How did you get this shit?

329
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,318
Took me fucking 17 months
to get this thing, okay?

330
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,437
Just look at this. Hang on for a second.

331
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,616
Go through my loupe.
Be careful. That's my best loupe.

332
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,950
- Let me see this, man.
- I want you to look at it.

333
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,696
You really into that motherfucker.

334
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,915
Isn't that the shit?

335
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,736
That's history right there.
You understand?

336
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,117
- How many carats is this?
- What, 4,000, 5,000 carats?

337
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,318
$3,000 a carat.
I'm not fucking bullshitting you.

338
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,080
- Why's it got so many colors in it, man?
- That's the thing.

339
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,629
They say you can see
the whole universe in opals.

340
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,598
That's how fucking old they are.

341
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,520
- Holy shit.
- I've been telling you.

342
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,656
- That's why I wanted you to see it.
- I gotta have this.

343
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,399
Your ass crazy, man.

344
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,954
From stone to stone.

345
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,350
Garnet's a stone. You know that.

346
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,636
That's a million-dollar opal
you're holding,

347
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,355
straight from the Ethiopian Jewish tribe.

348
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,678
I mean, this is old-school,
middle-earth shit.

349
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,275
Got a motherfucking dinosaur gem
in this bitch.

350
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,640
Dinosaur. That's right.

351
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,559
'Cause dinosaurs fucking
stared at this thing.

352
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,196
It's 110 million years old at the least.

353
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,840
- This is deep shit.
- Fuck basketball. Pass the rock.

354
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,513
Can't lean on the glass, KG.

355
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,076
Oh, shit!

356
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,355
You all right?

357
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,073
Get a fucking towel or something.

358
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,595
You heard me.
I was telling him not to lean.

359
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,936
- Is he all right?
- Don't cut your fucking self.

360
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,112
That's a sign.
That's a sign for that I need this.

361
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,236
That's what this is.

362
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,136
You better make sure
my nigga good, bro.

363
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,153
It's fucking glass. That's a lot
of weight you were putting on it.

364
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,880
That's a sign. I need this.
I need this right here.

365
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,555
It's not for sale.
I can't sell it to you.

366
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,479
- What you mean, it's not for sale?
- I can't do it.

367
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,478
Goddamn it. It's set for auction. I can't.

368
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,599
Why the fuck would you show me something
if I couldn't have it?

369
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,196
- Why the fuck would you bring this out?
- Excited. Excited to share it.

370
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,757
Well, let me hold it for a night then.
Let me wear it to the game tomorrow.

371
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,230
I'm going to the game.
I'll grab it from you.

372
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,936
Then meet you at Adley's
tomorrow morning, first thing.

373
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,839
Boom. Boom.
Just like that. It's perfect.

374
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,232
- Howard, come on.
- I can't.

375
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,096
- One night. He's good for it.
- They'll pull it from the auction.

376
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,796
You don't understand. This stone,
I'm really connecting with this, man.

377
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,118
I feel like I'm gonna have
40 or 50 on this, man.

378
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,520
You understand that?

379
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,216
You see what
I'm talking about, Howard?

380
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,616
This shit speaking to him. You know?

381
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,758
I'm gonna destroy
Philly tonight with this.

382
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,230
Nigga, this fucking thing
makes me feel like I can fly.

383
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,816
- Howard, you hear that?
- Yeah. Let him get that.

384
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,595
- You're going to "at" me at howiebling.
- Yes.

385
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,696
- Thirty fucking pics. I want likes.
- Yes. I got you.

386
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,936
- He's talking about at-ing me.
- Let me get a fucking shot.

387
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,519
That's a good idea, man.

388
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,398
- Come here. Come here.
- Look at this.

389
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,598
You hold it up. Look at this shit. Boom.

390
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,752
- Boom. Cool.
- You can't just...

391
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,957
Give me the Celtic ring. I want the ring.

392
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,616
- Come the fuck on.
- Collateral.

393
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,199
No, no. He's good money.

394
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,119
- I know he's good for it.
- That's a deal. That's a deal.

395
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,709
- That's a deal. I give you that.
- Thanks. All right.

396
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,952
I'll keep it right here,
right next to my Knicks '73.

397
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,680
- Classic. I like that.
- I appreciate you understanding.

398
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,160
Got you. Right.

399
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,913
But listen, you meet me.

400
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,992
Yeah, I'll meet your happy ass.

401
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,198
You will fucking bring that stone
to me at 9:00 in the morning.

402
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,476
Hey. Hey. Hey, listen to me.
No dicking around.

403
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,951
- You show up. You hear me?
- Chill. I'll see you there, motherfucker.

404
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,675
All right. Let's roll.
Let's do it, nigga. Let's do it.

405
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,280
- Buzz them out.
- I got his earrings.

406
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,875
Hey, the earrings.
Wait. Bring it out to him.

407
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,276
Keep them.
Keep them until tomorrow. I'll grab them.

408
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,752
Black Jew power, nigga.

409
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,036
- He's so extra.
- I'm fucking... I don't know.

410
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,199
- What the fuck.
- Yeah.

411
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,556
Who's gonna clean this fucking shit?

412
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,474
Eddie, boy, what are you doing?

413
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,200
<i>- What do you want?</i>
- Look what I got.

414
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,518
Look. You're gonna love this. Here.

415
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,757
Hey. What's that right there?

416
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,792
- Can you leave me alone?
<i>- What is it?</i>

417
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,556
It's Kevin Garnett's ring.
Championship ring, NBA, 2008.

418
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,791
- I knew you'd freak out.
<i>- Bitch!</i>

419
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,435
- All right. I love you, my boy.
<i>- All right. Bye.</i>

420
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,636
Alberto, you came to work.

421
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,200
- Ronstein.
- Hey, Howard.

422
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,318
- Break out your tray. Where is it?
- I got the tray right here.

423
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,596
I'd shake your hand,
but I know where it's been.

424
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,720
Look at this.

425
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,679
It's Kevin Garnett's
2008 championship ring.

426
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,316
- Championship ring?
- Championship ring, 2008.

427
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,160
- You want to pawn it or sell it?
- I want to pawn it.

428
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,056
- Let me take a quick look at it.
- I don't know what you're looking for.

429
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,296
- Check the diamond.
- That was just on his fucking finger.

430
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,357
It's single cut. It's not even full cut.

431
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,956
You talk to the fucking league
about the way they cut their shit.

432
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,776
- I understand, but they're worth less.
- Take a look at this. All right?

433
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,393
All right. It's his ring. I understand.

434
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,736
It's from his Instagram.
It's fucking blowing up right now.

435
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,717
I hear you.
So, what do you need for it?

436
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,197
I figure that thing is worth 80 grand.

437
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,511
Just loan it to me. That's it.
Just float it to me.

438
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,274
- I'll be back Friday.
- Number one, we both know what's in here.

439
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,159
We both know that the value
is mostly because it's memorabilia.

440
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,478
But it is a memorabilia piece.
So that's how you're gonna sell it, right?

441
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,158
Give me 50 G's. Just float it to me.

442
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,956
I'm gonna give you $25,000,
but I want an 8% vig on the ring.

443
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,954
Eight percent? How about
I give you a grand off the top?

444
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,440
I'm gonna come back Friday for it.

445
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,456
Last time you had something here for
six months. We wanna make sure up front.

446
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,598
Last time wasn't my fault.
We fucking went over that.

447
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,396
Let's make it quick... $21,000, 7% vig.

448
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,474
And you said you'd be back Friday.
If you're not back Friday, it's my ring.

449
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,656
If I don't bring it back Friday,
I'm a dead man, so...

450
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,195
- All right. Do we have a deal?
- Deal.

451
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,016
- Can you go get me the money?
- We'll get you the money.

452
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,509
All right.
Hey, good <i>Pesach.</i>

453
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,750
This is great.

454
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,830
<i>Seventieth and 1st?
What the fuck is he doing there?</i>

455
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,755
He's walking.
Now he's stopping. He's slowing down.

456
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,671
<i>- What?</i>
- He's doing something.

457
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,878
He's playing with his phone or something.
I can't make it out.

458
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,117
I can't see him. His back is to me.

459
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,456
He's hunched over. You can't see.

460
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,437
I don't know.
We can't see anything.

461
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,590
Here he goes.
Here he goes. He's going again.

462
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,876
<i>Wait. I just got a text from him.</i>

463
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,475
- What's he saying?
<i>- It's a picture of money.</i>

464
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,517
- This fucking prick.
<i>- He says, "Arno...</i>

465
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,069
- He's got fucking money.
<i>- ...I got your money right here."</i>

466
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,656
All right.
He's turning in somewhere.

467
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,114
A restaurant. Nino's.

468
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,555
- Hey, handsome, where's he at?
- He's in the back.

469
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,640
He's in the back.

470
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,514
Hey, you got him making meatballs
in the back?

471
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,636
All right.

472
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,638
You have your romaine.
You have your croutons.

473
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,315
You have your eggs.
No carrots in the Caesar salad.

474
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,711
- What do you want? I made your bet.
- I know. I know. I gotta change the bet.

475
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,952
I got $21,000 here,
so you add it on to the 19 grand.

476
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,072
- $40,000 in all.
- Scrap the whole bet?

477
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,720
Scrap the whole bet.
I want to make a six-way parlay.

478
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,040
- Celtics-Sixers game. What's the line?
- Still plus one.

479
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,470
Plus one.
Okay, so I want the Celtics to cover.

480
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,696
I want the Celtics halftime.

481
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,316
I want Garnett points and rebounds.
Garnett blocked shots.

482
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,993
- Celtics opening tip.
- All right.

483
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,296
- Do you take lightning bets?
- Yeah, but you don't want lightning bets.

484
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,516
Fine. A thousand dollars a point, okay?

485
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,240
- Take this. And this is a gift from me.
- What's this?

486
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,080
For just tolerating me
for all this time. Okay?

487
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,476
No, I already have a Rolex.
I don't need your watch.

488
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,816
Probably fell off a truck anyway.
Listen, what do you know?

489
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,957
Garnett this, Garnett that.
What do you know?

490
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,394
I don't know. I just know.

491
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,600
Well, I tell you what I know... it's
the dumbest fucking bet I ever heard of.

492
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,120
I disagree.

493
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,560
I disagree, Gary.

494
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,078
Shoot.
Let him shoot. Let him shoot.

495
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,840
- Fuck. Fuck.
<i>- Jrue Holiday.</i>

496
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,736
Fucker was five fucking steps into the...

497
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,200
<i>...with 18 points, hitting four of six
from three-point range.</i>

498
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,919
Jesus Christ.

499
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,436
That's it.

500
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,876
Dump it to KG. Finish it. Finish it.

501
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,752
Back them down. Back them down.

502
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,157
Boom! Fuck you! Yes, that's it.

503
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,960
That's it. That's my man.

504
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,471
Go. Get up on him. Get up on him.

505
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,676
Fucking...

506
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,229
Get the fuck up on him. Goddamn it.

507
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:57,599
Howard, what are you doing?
Howard, Beni is waiting for you.

508
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,270
- Okay, I'm coming up.
- It's 25 minutes past his bedtime. Go.

509
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,992
- Did he brush his teeth yet?
- Brush his teeth?

510
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,470
I sent you seven texts in the dark.

511
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,794
- Howard.
- Yeah.

512
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,439
It's the first quarter.

513
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,035
Fucking guy was in my shop earlier today.

514
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,952
Look at him. Soft touch.

515
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,856
- I don't care, Howard.
- Hit that fucking shit. Boom.

516
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,314
Go say good night to your son.

517
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,594
Okay, let me get up there.

518
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,400
I'll be right there.

519
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,873
Let me just get to a time-out.

520
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,751
This fucking ref is ridiculous.

521
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,315
- Now!
- All right! All right. I'm sorry.

522
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,711
I'm sorry. God-fucking-damn it.

523
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,995
<i>Time-out, Philly.</i>

524
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,111
<i>Garnett opening up
with four on the shot clock again.</i>

525
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,398
<i>Garnett, vintage game one for sure.</i>

526
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,240
<i>Fifteen points
on seven for eight from the field.</i>

527
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,714
Oh!

528
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,118
Give me a fucking break.

529
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,671
Fuck you.

530
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,839
Hey. Hey. Hey.

531
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,152
- Garnett's killing it right now.
- I know. Beni's sleeping. Keep it down.

532
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,711
- I'm sorry. I'm just so hyped.
- NBA is always the last two minutes.

533
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,836
So let's calm down.

534
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,077
- [Howard Hit that, KG!
- About to win money.

535
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,216
Jason's about to give me
25 bucks for the first half.

536
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,391
Double that up last half,
I might get 50 bucks.

537
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,437
Your father bet a lot
of money on this one.

538
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,989
Really? How much? How much?

539
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,960
- You don't want to know.
- A lot though, right?

540
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:40,158
Yes. Put that shit in the fucking hole.

541
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,471
That's right. Come on.
You can dunk again. Dunk again.

542
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,113
Boom. Boom. Boom. All right.

543
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,039
Fucking amazing.
Fucking amazing, all right?

544
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,560
He's down. He's asleep.

545
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,911
<i>But no.
He's like, "You can paint.</i>

546
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,576
<i>You can follow your hobbies and your bliss
and your entrepreneurial thing,"</i>

547
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,672
<i>and Stephanie and Annalise went, "Ooh."</i>

548
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,909
<i>What would do
if you had two weeks to live?</i>

549
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,520
<i>That's a good question.</i>

550
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,116
Can you flip it to ESPN
just for one second?

551
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,237
This is a huge game.
That's why he's going so crazy up there.

552
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,439
You know, I'm tempted to wrangle the kids
downstairs right now and get it over with.

553
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,833
You really want to do that?

554
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,996
- I don't know how sensitive that is.
- You're calling me insensitive?

555
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,192
Thought we both agreed
that we'd wait till after Passover.

556
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,736
Next, you'll be saying you want to wait
until after the summer.

557
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,229
I'm not opposed to waiting
until after summer.

558
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,075
It's a commercial. Can you just put
the game on for two fucking minutes?

559
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,992
Until my car gets here?

560
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,039
<i>Hey, that's not Chuck the Body.</i>

561
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,712
<i>No words can describe that.</i>

562
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,920
<i>Forty-one?
I don't know how old these guys are.</i>

563
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,553
<i>But you can't tell by their age.</i>

564
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,840
<i>You're saying ages all older than you are.</i>

565
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,437
- <i>Here is KG.</i>
- This is crazy.

566
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:09,236
<i>KG hits the shot from outside.
He'll be 36 on Saturday.</i>

567
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:13,439
<i>And he puts the Celtics
over the century mark, 101-76.</i>

568
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,273
<i>Garnett now with 27.</i>

569
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:21,238
Yes! Oh, God, yes!

570
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,233
Oh, fuck. Oh, my God.

571
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,636
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

572
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,000
Oh, my God.

573
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,713
- Hey, change of plans.
- What's up?

574
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:38,192
Take the exit, 49th Street
and Third Avenue, Smith & Wollensky's.

575
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,873
- Everything okay?
- I just...

576
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,553
- What's your name?
- Dallas.

577
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,439
Davis, I just hit very big, very big.

578
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,830
Oh, my God.

579
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,879
<i>Five-point tag,
spin back for the alley-oop.</i>

580
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,998
<i>And if he wasn't fouled,
he was gonna posterize somebody.</i>

581
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,040
<i>KG having fun.</i>

582
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,796
Julia?

583
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,600
Jules?

584
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,640
Hey.

585
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,594
- <i>Hey, what's up?</i>
- Baby, where are you at?

586
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,392
<i>I'm just coming back right now.
I'm in the elevator. Why, what's up?</i>

587
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,194
I got held up.
I'm just on my way back now.

588
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,397
Yeah, Dinah was on a tear tonight.

589
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,555
<i>That sucks. How far away are you?</i>

590
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,793
I am in the tunnel, just getting in there.

591
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,559
<i>- Okay. So you're very close.</i>
- Yes.

592
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,235
<i>- Hold on. I gotta go I gotta go.</i>
- Wait, wait, wait.

593
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,800
- Hey.
<i>- What?</i>

594
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,952
I can't wait to see you.
I'm in an incredible mood.

595
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,033
<i>Okay, I got another line.
I gotta go. Bye.</i>

596
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,875
He's in the tunnel as we speak.

597
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,953
And I still have to set up the steaks,
I still have to get ready.

598
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,839
Because his gem came. Hello.
Do you not listen to me?

599
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,912
I've been talking about it all day.

600
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,993
I'm gonna wear the... Remember
the green that I took the photo of?

601
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,351
Yeah, I know. I know. Yeah, yeah.

602
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,720
We should go.

603
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,760
Okay, I gotta go. Love you. Bye.

604
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,875
I'm gonna come! I'm gonna come!

605
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,271
- I can't help it. I had to get you.
- Oh, my God!

606
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,477
Why the fuck did you do that?

607
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,199
You see how fucking sweet you look.

608
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,919
You look so gorgeous.

609
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,356
I just hit so fucking big.

610
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,397
- I hit so big.
- How big?

611
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,074
Feel how wet I am?

612
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,912
<i>I'm almost there. I'm almost there.</i>

613
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,957
What? You told me that already!

614
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,191
<i>I hit mad traffic.
What you want me to do?</i>

615
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,557
Nine o'clock we were supposed to be there!
It's fucking 9:43!

616
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,030
<i>The whole city is clogged up.
I can't do anything about it.</i>

617
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,716
Not everybody is on Demany time, man!
Let's move!

618
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,394
Okay, you can tell Anne we're here.

619
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,719
- Hold on one second. Hi.
- Hi.

620
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:36,675
Anne Deva? Howard Ratner and his partner.
We're all ready to go.

621
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,592
Okay. Well, when your partner gets here,

622
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,956
I will let her know
that you've both arrived.

623
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,032
You can sit over there if you'd like.

624
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,112
Yes?

625
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,896
<i>I'm pulling up right now. Come out.</i>

626
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,958
- I said, "I'm inside."
<i>- I'm not gonna find parking.</i>

627
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,750
- Double-park the car. Do it.
<i>- I'm not getting no ticket for you.</i>

628
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,400
<i>So come meet me.
I want to talk to you.</i>

629
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,632
- Are you fucking kidding me?
<i>- No. I'm pulling up. Come out.</i>

630
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,712
Do you have any guests or anything?

631
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,352
- We'll be right back.
- Okay.

632
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,352
Fuck. Fuck.

633
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,110
Stupid...

634
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,514
Howard! Howard!

635
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,432
Jesus. How'd you find me?

636
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,416
- Your office told me where you are.
- You following me?

637
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,336
- We need the money today.
- My office would never tell you that.

638
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,976
- This is the last straw.
- Get out of here!

639
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,277
You haven't been returning my phone calls
or texts. You can't take ten minutes?

640
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,696
- What, you bring your heavy with you?
- Yeah. You got my money?

641
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,554
- All right. You want money?
- Yeah. You owe me 32 grand.

642
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,518
- Fine, fine, fine. Look.
- For the games.

643
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,195
There's 30 grand.
Fucking sell that for 15 G's.

644
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,956
- Fifteen G's? Where am I gonna sell this?
- Go to Wimpy's, 55th and Fifth Avenue.

645
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,594
Go there. Put that in your pocket.

646
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,640
Hey, hey. Where's it at?
Where's the gem?

647
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,280
- Get in real quick.
- Give me the gem. I'll run it upstairs.

648
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,176
- Get in.
- I don't know anything about a watch.

649
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,998
Get the fuck out! I don't want a watch!

650
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,072
You just gave it to me
for the money you owe me.

651
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,795
- This is half the money!
- I'm not buying watches right now!

652
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,634
Back the fuck up!
Don't touch my shit. All right?

653
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,552
Walk the fuck away, man!

654
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,791
- Give me the opal.
- Get in so I can talk to you.

655
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,760
They're waiting on us. We're late.
What am I getting in the fucking car for?

656
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,035
Jesus Christ!

657
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,755
Get out of here
with that fucking fugazi shit.

658
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,234
Who the fuck were they?

659
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,320
Fuck.

660
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,194
Why am I in your car right now?
They're fucking waiting on us.

661
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,519
Listen, we're at the hotel, getting ready,
about to go party. Got three bad bitches.

662
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,472
I don't have time for this.
Where is my opal?

663
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,353
And KG leaves his fucking ID upstairs.

664
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,392
Demany, we don't have time.

665
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,711
They're waiting for us!
Where's the fucking opal?

666
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,277
- Garnett got it! All right?
- Garnett's got it? This guy fucked us.

667
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,155
- I don't know what you want me to do.
- Call him up. Let me talk to him.

668
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,079
I can't call him right now.
He's at practice.

669
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,016
Tell him I will give him another opal
for free.

670
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,351
I can't call him because
he is at practice, my nigga.

671
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,750
He's not gonna answer his phone
for me, God, nobody else.

672
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,275
Then we're going to practice.
We're going to practice.

673
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,310
- So you want me to go to Philly right now?
- He's in Philly? We're going to Philly.

674
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,551
I just got back from Philly, man.

675
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,599
It's two fucking hours to get there.
Come on. Come on.

676
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,796
Fucking cock...

677
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,795
- Fuck this.
- Fuckin' retarded, man.

678
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,600
All right,
we gotta be in and out.

679
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,955
Got my daughter's play tonight.

680
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,595
Who is that? Is that KG?
Tell him we're here. We're coming in.

681
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,911
Yo, you got to calm your happy ass down.

682
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,600
Are we going inside the facility,
or we gonna meet him out here?

683
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,155
- Just chill the fuck out.
- I hope we see Rondo in there.

684
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,074
I'd love to tell him "Thank you"
for dropping all those dimes.

685
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,160
They busy.

686
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,438
What the fuck is it with you Jewish niggas
and basketball anyway?

687
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:33,194
I'll have you know, the first two points
scored in the NBA was a Jew.

688
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,034
- Yeah, yeah. Who? Fred Flintstein?
- No!

689
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,192
Ossie Schectman, 1946.
Played for the Knicks.

690
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,033
There we go.
Yeah, this is where the big boys play.

691
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,271
Always, always got to practice
and always got...

692
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,319
Look at this.
This is sick. Sick. Oh, my God.

693
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,312
Hey, check this out.

694
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,716
Cookies.

695
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,856
- Yo, my man!
- Rondo, he's coming up!

696
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,112
He can't help himself.
He's gonna have to finish.

697
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,112
And he scores!

698
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,536
- Can you give us an update?
- Hey. I need to get through.

699
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,676
Sorry, brother.

700
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,280
What's changing for game two?

701
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,430
Demany!

702
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,277
- I got one coming back.
- What's up?

703
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,629
I'm with him.

704
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,633
No, no, no. I'm with him.
Demany. What the fuck?

705
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,176
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- What's he fucking...

706
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,078
I'm with him. I came with him.

707
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,576
- You saw me walk through the door.
- I didn't see you walk through the door.

708
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,160
- What's your name?
- I won't be on a list. I came with him.

709
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,756
I came with him. I came with him.
What the fuck is he doing to me?

710
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,911
Cocksucker fucking works for me!

711
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,520
Is Marcel excited?

712
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,056
I think she's a little nervous.

713
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,936
Little nervous.
Well, it's the lead part.

714
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,236
I know. I'm very proud of her.

715
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:45,234
- And Danny's got a role, too.
- Small part. He's nervous, but...

716
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,953
- Nothing fazes him.
- You working?

717
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,594
He said she was amazing.

718
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,114
Hang on one second.

719
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,759
What are you guys doing for the break?

720
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,754
Uh, um...

721
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,036
We're not...
We're not doing anything this year.

722
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,395
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

723
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,400
Wow.

724
00:40:59,401 --> 00:41:01,137
- That's not like you guys.
- Yeah, how come?

725
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,753
Howard, how come? Howard?

726
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,911
- Everything okay?
- Howard?

727
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,510
- No vacation?
- No, we're...

728
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,832
Next year, we're gonna take a bigger trip.
Saving up for that.

729
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,196
- Gonna go to Europe.
- That's nice.

730
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,670
So, yeah, do a little culture.

731
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,719
- These kids are becoming morons.
- What...

732
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,639
- Oh, yeah. Well...
- We'll be morons in Cancún.

733
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,677
Right.
Especially on the trapeze, you know?

734
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,752
- Good luck to Danny tonight.
- Yeah, yeah.

735
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,800
- When's he coming?
- We just talked about Danny.

736
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,878
- Okay.
- What are you going to do for Passover?

737
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,713
- Is your sister coming?
- Yes.

738
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,837
What are you doing? Who do you got?

739
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,634
I got six different people
playing six different games.

740
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,633
Hey, we're all making...
Hey. Who tapped me?

741
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,074
Who was it?

742
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,056
That would be nice.

743
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,311
You gonna do the questions?
The four questions?

744
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,518
- Yeah? You practicing?
- I've been practicing.

745
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,030
I don't know how
we're going to keep it in Mexico.

746
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,950
- Well, good luck to Marcel.
- I know. And to Danny.

747
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,190
- Where are you going?
- Daddy's got to go the bathroom.

748
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,920
- She's gonna be on in just a second.
- I'll be back. Thank you.

749
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,350
Howard, Marcel is about to get on the...

750
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,560
- Okay, I'll be right back.
- Howard, everything okay?

751
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,792
- This is fucked up, guys.
- What's so fucked up about it?

752
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,473
- Could I speak to you guys outside?
- You sure you want to do that?

753
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,029
Yeah? All right. Excuse me.

754
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,791
Yo, yo, Howard.
Hey! What are we gonna do here, man?

755
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,314
Hey, you. Come on, man.

756
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,600
That's my family!

757
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,760
Get the fuck off!

758
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,750
Yo, get him! Get him!

759
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,035
Hey, look out. It's gonna be great.

760
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,472
Are you kidding me,
how good you guys look?

761
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:13,600
- Dad, what are you doing?
- Marcel, break a leg! We're all here!

762
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,680
Fuck.

763
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,240
Get him! Get him!

764
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,160
Fuck.

765
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,754
Come here, you motherfucker.
Hey, fuck you! Fuck you...

766
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,432
I'm fucked.

767
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,394
Come on. Get up. Get up.

768
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:04,154
- Hey, motherfucker.
- I'm up. I'm up.

769
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,518
- I'm coming.
- Get in the fucking car.

770
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,910
- Hey, what the fuck?
- You fucking bit me.

771
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,997
I am fucking coming!

772
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,080
Arno!

773
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,000
- Get in the fucking car!
- Arno! Arno!

774
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,434
Get him in the fucking...

775
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,914
Okay, go, go, go. Come on.
Let's get out of here.

776
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,354
Arno, what is happening?

777
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,995
You don't know me.
Don't fucking say my name.

778
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,109
- Give me the keys.
- The fucking Jew bit me!

779
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,759
Hey. What's happening right now?

780
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,556
I told you how things were gonna go
if you didn't start to behave.

781
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,280
How was I not behaving?
Explain to me. I'm sorry.

782
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,235
I think I was very explicit on the phone
about how things were gonna go.

783
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,152
You like the way things are going now?

784
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,839
Give me the fucking keys to your car.

785
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,719
What are you gonna do,
have them steal my Mercedes?

786
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,679
Look what the fuck you did!
You fucking bit my...

787
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,989
Arno, fucking talk to me.

788
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,351
Don't listen to him, Arno.
It's not a game.

789
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,600
Stop saying my fucking name!

790
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:04,355
I have every intention of paying you back.
I'm broke right now.

791
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,696
- You broke? What's that, motherfucker?
- Look at that.

792
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,279
Do you remember that? Look at it!

793
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:12,798
That is money that's not mine
that I sent to you

794
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,872
because I wanted to calm you down.

795
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,919
We know for a fact that you
placed a bet with that money.

796
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,713
I never placed a bet with that money.

797
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,634
Yes, you did.
Let me ask you something.

798
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,916
I heard that Beni and Eddie
are going to Timber Lake.

799
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,176
And you know what else I heard?

800
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,317
I heard you've resurfaced
your fucking swimming pool.

801
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,518
- Do you know how that makes me feel?
- I never resurfaced anything.

802
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,114
I don't know who said that!

803
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,192
Give me the keys!
Shut the fuck up!

804
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:38,916
- Give me the keys to your fucking car!
- Take the fucking keys.

805
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,151
Fine. All right.

806
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,596
Listen. I do... I did... I admit it.

807
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,794
I made a bet. And guess what.

808
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,920
Here's the thing.
I hit. I hit the bet big.

809
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:54,789
You think I'm stupid.

810
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,679
You think I'm stupid, Howard,
you and your whole fucking family.

811
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,037
I'll call the book right now.
You get on the phone, and he'll tell you.

812
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,436
I saw your bookie!
You're talking about Gary?

813
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,716
You spoke to Gary about what?

814
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,874
About you, about how you're taking
my money all over town, placing bets.

815
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:13,317
You know what that does to me?
Do you know how offensive that is to me?

816
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,396
What, you stopped the bet?

817
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,511
- What do you think, asshole?
- You stopped the bet?

818
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,233
Shut the fuck up!

819
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,838
Congratulations, Arno!

820
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,992
You fucked ourselves out of $600,000.

821
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,072
- Shit!
- Take his clothes off.

822
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,878
Give me that fucking bracelet.
Give me the fucking shoes.

823
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:41,512
- Hold this motherfucker.
- Howard, you did this to yourself.

824
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,554
Take the fucking pants.
Take the fucking pants!

825
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:50,151
I got a fucking gift for you, man!
I got a gift!

826
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,550
The auction is next fucking week!

827
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,950
Give me my glasses!
I need my fucking glasses!

828
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,151
Shut the fuck up! Back up!

829
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,112
Pull up up here. Come on. Let's go.

830
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,040
Let me explain something to you,
motherfucker.

831
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,914
Monday, I want the money.
Arno gets the money. All right?

832
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,440
- I'm not fucking around anymore.
- Where's my phone?

833
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,631
- You hear me?
- Get him out of the car!

834
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,911
Get out of the fucking car!

835
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,392
Come on, come on. Let's go.

836
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,176
- Arno! Arno!
- Get in the fucking car!

837
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,715
- Get in the fucking car!
- All right. All right. All right.

838
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:21,032
Arno, listen to me. Arno, Arno, Arno!

839
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,456
- Get in the car!
- Take...

840
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,040
- Get in the fucking car!
- Don't worry about Arno.

841
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,680
- No, no, I want the underwear.
- No, no!

842
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,536
Give me that.
Give me your fucking underwear.

843
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,676
Give me!

844
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,797
Give me your underwear, you cocksucker.

845
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,760
Now fucking rot in there.

846
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:42,079
Fuck you, Arno,
you cocksucking motherfucker!

847
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,920
Help!

848
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,276
Help! Help! Help!

849
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,714
I am fucked.

850
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:01,198
Please, please, please. Please pick up.

851
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,273
Pick up the fucking phone, please.

852
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,597
- Come on. Come on.
<i>- Howard, where are you?</i>

853
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:11,354
<i>Marcel is up on the stage.
What do you want?</i>

854
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,397
I locked my keys in the trunk of the car.

855
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,712
Can you please come to the parking lot
and open it for me?

856
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,160
Fucking shit.

857
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,111
It's okay. Thank you. Okay.

858
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,110
Sorry.

859
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,556
I'll meet you right back inside.
It's all good now.

860
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:46,680
Let me get dressed.

861
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,476
What could you possibly be looking for
in the forest

862
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,353
dressed in such thin paper rags?

863
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,796
My wicked stepmother
has condemned me to die,

864
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,952
lest I fill this basket with roses
before the coming of dawn.

865
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:19,195
Besides our cottage is our magic garden.

866
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,556
It protects the roses from the snow.

867
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,997
Go now and fill your basket
to your heart's content.

868
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,470
Just watch your fucking sister.
It's fine.

869
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,670
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

870
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,400
We must bestow a gift upon her.

871
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,678
I know. Every time she speaks,

872
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,719
gold coins shall spill forth
from her mouth.

873
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,559
This will be our gift!

874
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,030
Quick. He approaches now.

875
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,096
This is Danny's part. He's coming out.

876
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:55,157
Hark! Who goes there?

877
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,119
He did so good.

878
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:05,680
Wow.

879
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:06,800
Fuck.

880
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:08,789
Jesus Christ.

881
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:11,830
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey!

882
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,037
You picked up, huh?

883
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,793
When I block the call, you pick up?

884
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,315
When you know it's me, you don't?
What was that all about?

885
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,397
<i>Nah, I knew it was you calling.
That's why I picked up.</i>

886
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,472
Hey, where's my fucking gem?

887
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,392
<i>Hey, hey, you need to calm down.</i>

888
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,790
<i>- All right? Something's happened.</i>
- Listen, motherfucker.

889
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,116
I want my fucking property.
You understand me?

890
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,475
<i>Hey, watch your mouth!</i>

891
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:35,120
<i>All right? You're not dealing
with some broke-ass nigga.</i>

892
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,193
Hey, you fucking put me
on that bus ride home.

893
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,555
You think that was funny?

894
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,160
What the fuck was that all about?

895
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:44,392
- That fucking bus was disgusting!
<i>- What the fuck do you want me to do?</i>

896
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,591
<i>I go into a locker room
with your silly ass.</i>

897
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,911
<i>That makes me look really fucking suspect.</i>

898
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,799
- Where's my gem? Where is it?
<i>- I'm trying to help you not fuck up.</i>

899
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:55,317
<i>- Jesus Christ. I have it on me right now.</i>
- You have it on you?

900
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:59,558
<i>- Yes. I'm about to be back in the city.</i>
- Okay.

901
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,030
You going to this fucking
Weeknd thing tonight?

902
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,751
<i>I mean, I wasn't planning on it,
but I could.</i>

903
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:10,151
You could? No, it's not "you could."
You will. You'll meet me there.

904
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,879
It smells good.
What is it, barbecue chicken?

905
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:41,072
So, I wanted to talk
about the trunk scenario.

906
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,760
That was literally
the most awkward thing, like...

907
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,199
- Where are you going?
- I'm heading into the city.

908
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,949
Late-night event. Gonna go...

909
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,713
- Is this the cake?
- ...until 2:00, 3:00, you never know.

910
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,797
So I'll be exhausted tomorrow.

911
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,560
Yeah, okay, sure.

912
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,235
Good night.

913
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,480
Anyway, I'll finish
the conversation later.

914
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,796
But it was literally so awkward, like...

915
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,879
Who are you talking to?

916
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:20,790
Jessica.

917
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,314
Hi, Jessica.

918
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,915
- How good was our girl tonight?
- You can't hear her.

919
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:28,033
Okay. Well, then,
just hang up for a second.

920
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:31,033
Let me talk to you, two secs.

921
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,270
I'll call you back.

922
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,113
What?

923
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:39,150
I was very proud of you tonight.
You were beyond incredible.

924
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,960
- Yeah, you told me five times already.
- Well, I just wanted...

925
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:46,074
You really didn't know
how proud I was, okay?

926
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,954
So I really...
I just really want you to know.

927
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,759
Okay. Well, I do.

928
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,033
Everything is cool, right?

929
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,958
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

930
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,157
I just thought I would check in with you.

931
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,356
Okay.

932
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,793
Make sure everything is good.

933
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,314
Why wouldn't I be good?

934
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,596
I don't know. I just thought I'd check in.

935
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:09,559
Okay. Well, I literally don't know
what you're talking about, so...

936
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,677
That's right, because I'm an idiot.

937
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,279
That's why you love me.

938
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,557
Okay? I'm gonna get into the city,
and I'll see you in the morning.

939
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,273
- Have fun.
- Like I always do.

940
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,033
Anyway, where was I?

941
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:26,636
You know how I have, like,
a complete resting-bitch face? So...

942
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,677

00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,030
- Give me the opal.
- I don't have it.

982
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,918
You come by the shop
anytime you want.

983
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:25,479

- I'm sorry. I don't have it.

984
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,872

- KG got it. I don't have it.

985
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,038
What the fuck are you talking about?
You said on the phone you had it!

986
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,311
Hey! Man, I don't even want that shit.

987
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,756
Why the fuck are you here

00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:41,800

989
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:45,317
- You got a problem with that?

1020
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,515
- What are you doing?
- Julia, what are you doing?

1021
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,159
- No touching.
- Come on.

1022
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:13,475
No touching.

1023
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,000
I want to fuck you so bad.

1024
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,520
How bad?

1025
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,920
- I'll show you.
- Mm-mm.

1026
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,399
I said, no touching.

1027
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:24,994
Feel this shit. Here, feel this.

1028
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,912
Oh, my God.

1029
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:30,270
How are you even this hard right now?

1030
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,272
Slow down. Where you going?

1031
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,600
I was already inside.

1032
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,336
Listen, I don't remember
seeing you inside.

1033
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:40,034
I'm friends with The Weeknd.
He told me to come after his set.

1034
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,671
- Hey, Flawless!
- Listen, watch the yelling.

1035
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:45,320
- Fucking... Flawless!
- No screaming over here.

1036
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,874
Yo! Yo!

1037
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,196
- Use the phone!
- Tell this guy to let me in!

1038
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:50,360
Come here!

1039
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,234
The legend is in
the motherfucking building!

1040
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,232
Come here! He's not letting me through.

1041
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,360
- They don't know me, bro.
- Let him in. Let him in.

1042
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:00,359
Sorry, man. He's with me. Yeah.
That's my guy. What's up, sexy?

1043
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:01,635
- So how we doing?
- Fine.

1044
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:04,758
Hey, check this out. You see this
Rolls-Royce I did, from Miami?

1045
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,594
Yeah, yeah.
Richie showed me that poison shit.

1046
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,080
Where's Julia? She in there?

1047
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,152
- Yeah, she's back there somewhere.
- With who?

1048
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:13,336
Do you know what's going on
with my Michael Jackson pendant?

1049
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,955
- What about that?
- What do you mean? I need it back.

1050
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:18,675
- Yeah, it's in my safe.
- I'm coming by tomorrow to pick it up.

1051
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,956
Just help me to sell this thing
to The Weeknd.

1052
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,080
- You understand?
- Yeah.

1053
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:24,760
- What do you mean, "yeah"?
- Where... Where is she?

1054
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,911
- You know?
- Yeah.

1055
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,476
Well, where?

1056
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,436
Where, where, where?

1057
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,856
I don't mean to get in your business.
I don't want to get involved.

1058
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:35,997
But I saw her go to the bathroom
with The Weeknd.

1059
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,320
Julia!

1060
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:46,397
- Oh, shit.
- Julia, are you in there?

1061
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,696
I said to hold the door, bro.

1062
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:50,056
- Open up the door!
- Yo! Someone's in there.

1063
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,434
Shut the fuck up!

1064
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,830
Give me one second.
I'm washing my hands.

1065
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,320
- Jesus!
- We were just doing coke.

1066
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,336
- Fuck you.
- Nothing happened. Howard!

1067
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:58,476
What the fuck?

1068
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,479
You fucker!

1069
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,353
- Fuck you!
- Stop fighting!

1070
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:17,995
Hey, get the fuck back over here! Pussy!

1071
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:19,434
Fuck you!

1072
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:21,791
Fuck that motherfucker right there!

1073
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:23,439
Bitch-ass motherfucker!

1074
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:27,033
- Shut the fuck up!
- I'm so sorry, Howard!

1075
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:28,474
Fuck you!

1076
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,476
Let's go. Get the fuck out!

1077
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:33,950
You tell that fucking guy he's sued!

1078
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:35,976
- He's getting sued.
- Hey, Howard! Howard!

1079
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,070
Howard! Howard!

1080
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,720
And what fucking DJ
is gonna play his shit?

1081
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:42,315
I know every fucking DJ in this town.

1082
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,039
Fuck all you losers!

1083
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,874
Yeah, you smell like his fucking cologne!

1084
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,917
We didn't do anything, Howard!

1085
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,719
Yeah, right, right.

1086
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,393
Fuck him.

1087
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,159
You blew a huge fucking sale for me!

1088
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:58,709
What were you selling,
your fucking hot snatch?

1089
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:02,430
Throw my whole fucking life away
for this skank over here.

1090
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:05,638
Wow! Okay, now I'm a fucking skank?

1091
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:07,776
- Where the fuck are you, you cock?
- Listen, Howard!

1092
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,996
You knew what the fuck it was
when you met me.

1093
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:13,471
That's right. Yeah, that's why
I wish I never fucking met you.

1094
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:15,517
- Right here.
- Oh, wow.

1095
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:18,911
- That's great, Howard.
- Get out of my fucking way.

1096
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,037
- Howard!
- Go fuck The Weeknd. All right?

1097
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:23,351
We didn't fucking do anything!

1098
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,349
Go. Go. It's fine. Go. Go.

1099
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,636
Good night. Bye. Get the fuck away.

1100
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,120
- Howard.
- Go.

1101
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,200
Howard.

1102
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,958
Howard! Get out of the fucking car!

1103
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,440
Get the fuck out of the way.

1104
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:39,150
What are you gonna do, Howard?
What are you gonna do, big tough guy?

1105
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:42,360
- I didn't fucking do anything with him.
- Get the fuck out of here.

1106
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:46,195
- Get the fuck away. Go fuck the guy.
- Fuck you, Howard!

1107
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:49,432
- I'll see you tomorrow, Howard.
- Fuck you.

1108
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,796
- Yeah, fuck you.
- Let's go. Go.

1109
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:52,996
Fuck you.

1110
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:29,077
What the fuck are you looking at?

1111
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,110
Nothing much.

1112
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,112
Oh, funny. Stupid bitch.

1113
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,999
That's why you're in line
in the fucking cold. Yeah.

1114
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:38,080
Dumb bitch.

1115
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:12,039
No, no, listen. Anne, Anne.

1116
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,038
I'm looking at it.
I'm looking at the opal.

1117
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:17,557
- <i>You're missing the point.</i>
- I'm looking at it now. It's gorgeous.

1118
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:20,109
<i>It is not you who should be
looking at it, it's me.</i>

1119
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:22,954
- Turn that down.
<i>- Let me explain something to you.</i>

1120
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:27,114
<i>Your opal is one of 75 items
I have to okay for the auction.</i>

1121
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:29,914
<i>All of them but yours have been cleaned,
catalogued and appraised.</i>

1122
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,038
I'm doing some appraisals of my own, okay?

1123
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:35,016
And then I'm gonna bring it to you today.

1124
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:37,120
<i>I am on the precipice
of pulling it right now.</i>

1125
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:39,959
- I swear to you, please.
<i>- End of the day or we're done.</i>

1126
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:43,397
- I'm getting a call now. I have to go.
<i>- End of the day. I'm serious.</i>

1127
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:49,313
This is Howard Ratner. Hi, Jenna.
Thank you for calling me back so quickly.

1128
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,835
<i>That message you left
actually was very disturbing.</i>

1129
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,752
I didn't mean to worry you.

1130
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:55,536
<i>Would you mind telling me
what this is about?</i>

1131
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:58,712
I saw online that your boss
represents Kevin Garnett.

1132
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:01,759
<i>- I'm gonna have to put you on hold.</i>
- Okay, sure. I'll hang on.

1133
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,877
Howard, Julia is on line one.

1134
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:07,431
No. Tell her no. I'm not here. Fuck it.

1135
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Where are you?

1136
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,800
<i>Why aren't you answering your phone?</i>

1137
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:16,352
I asked you a question. Where are you?

1138
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,477
<i>I stayed at Kat's house.
Where else do you think?</i>

1139
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,536
<i>I couldn't fucking go home
with you acting that way.</i>

1140
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:24,395
No, that's... So let me guess.
You're not coming to work today?

1141
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:25,480
<i>I would like to.</i>

1142
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:28,473
That must be nice
to come to work whenever you feel like it.

1143
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:31,350
<i>- Howard.</i>
- Is that good?

1144
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:34,478
Is that good?
Maybe you should take a nap then.

1145
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:38,873
Take a nap. Get your rest.
You need to remain attractive, right?

1146
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:42,433
Answer me.

1147
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:46,070
<i>I just want to sit down and talk to you.
I don't want to do this right now.</i>

1148
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,856
And I just need to work, okay?

1149
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:50,016
I need to work to make sure
that your cheating ass is taken care of.

1150
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:52,760
Celtics Player Personnel on line two.

1151
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:53,916
Goodbye!

1152
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
This is Howard Ratner.

1153
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:58,376
<i>My assistant told me that
you called. How are you doing?</i>

1154
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:00,471
I'm not gonna lie to you.
I could be better.

1155
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:02,256
<i>Sorry to hear that.
So what can I do for you?</i>

1156
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:06,115
I've been having a situation
with one of your higher-profile players,

1157
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:10,433
and I'm moments away right now
from making things very ugly for you.

1158
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:13,160
<i>- Okay. Can you hang on for a second...</i>
- No. I'm not hanging on.

1159
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:15,550
I happen to be a litigious individual.

1160
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:19,198
And I am a second away
from hanging up right now

1161
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:22,034
and calling my lawyer and the police.

1162
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,696
<i>- I have no idea what you're talking about.</i>
- KG is here with Demany.

1163
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:27,216
<i>You're starting to sound like an asshole,
so maybe you want to back up and...</i>

1164
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:28,240
Never mind.

1165
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:31,995
Kevin!

1166
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:35,553
- Hey, hey!
- Look at him. Smiling man.

1167
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,790
Buzz them in.

1168
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:41,511
- Buzz them.
- I am. I am, Howard.

1169
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:42,840
Buzz the fucking door.

1170
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:46,470
Go to the other buzzer, please.
Hurry up. Hurry up.

1171
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:48,756
Be right there. Go ahead.

1172
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:50,274
It's not working.

1173
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:51,589
Goddamn it.

1174
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,751
Goddamn it. Just hang on. Sorry.

1175
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,479
- Open this shit up, man.
- I'm sorry.

1176
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:58,496
- Ain't got time for this. We got a game.
- The magnet sometimes doesn't connect.

1177
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:00,576
- I don't give a fuck about that.
- You brought the gem?

1178
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:03,240
- I'm claustrophobic.
- Okay. All right. Good.

1179
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,416
- There it is. All right.
- I'm gonna go downstairs and wait.

1180
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,671
You can't leave because
that one's locked also.

1181
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:09,873
Get a fucking hammer.

1182
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:11,917
Roman. Roman, he needs a hammer.

1183
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,200
He'll be right there.

1184
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:14,760
Let me get a hammer.

1185
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:16,752
Honestly, it's gonna be a second.

1186
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:19,309
- Move it!
- I don't know if this'll work. We'll see.

1187
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,278
- Give me the hammer.
- I'm on it. I'm coming.

1188
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:24,637
This usually works. This'll work.
Give me this.

1189
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,518
And get ready to buzz.

1190
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,912
- Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry. Buzz, buzz.

1191
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,913
- That shit loud as a bitch, man.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

1192
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,514
Buzz. Hit it from the side, please.

1193
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:36,216
- Flawless is here.
- Get rid of this motherfucker.

1194
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:38,216
- Tell him goodbye.
- Oh, my God. Flawless is here?

1195
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:40,118
Goodbye to fucking Flawless!

1196
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,760
Roman! Roman!

1197
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:44,194
- Come out here.
- Oh, shit.

1198
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:46,749
All right, listen.
We're having a fucking connection issue.

1199
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:51,631
Just get me some fucking metal shavings
and the tool-fucking-kit. All right?

1200
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:53,712
- Goddamn it.
- He's gotta be kidding.

1201
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:57,997
I'm going to get this open.
I promise you this'll work.

1202
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:00,754
Hurry the fuck up, Roman.
Thank you. Thank you.

1203
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:03,309
Yo, Howard! I'm here to buy the opal.

1204
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:05,312
- It's game day for me!
- I know. I know it is.

1205
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,198
- What the fuck is going on?
- Listen.

1206
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,760
I got 175,000 in here.

1207
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:12,231
I told you this thing
is worth over $1 million.

1208
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:14,391
Come on, man.
What the fuck are you doing?

1209
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:18,110
- Four courtside seats.
- I live in New York.

1210
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,118
Open the... Nigga, listen.

1211
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,296
- Listen to him.
- I wanna give it to you for free.

1212
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:25,438
I'm that kind of guy.
Just I'm tied into an auction right now.

1213
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:26,789
What auction?

1214
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:29,480
The auction... Listen, make a bid.
Make a bid at the auction.

1215
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:30,816
- When is it? When?
- It's Monday.

1216
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,479
- Monday.
- Tell him to come to...

1217
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:33,994
- Let him rent it then.
- I can't.

1218
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:37,357
I hold it until Monday.
You'll get it back Monday night. Perfect.

1219
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:41,076
- Kevin, I hate letting you down like this.
- You say no to everything.

1220
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,237
- Say yes to something.
- I want to, Kevin.

1221
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:45,516
I fucking love you.
I feel like an asshole.

1222
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,159
- Believe me.
- You are!

1223
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:50,756
Come down. Let me fucking do this.
Jesus... I got this!

1224
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:53,753
God-fucking-damn it.
I gotta do everything.

1225
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:56,156
Please, stop knocking.
It's not gonna help.

1226
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:57,316
Go, go.

1227
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:00,760
I'm so goddamn sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1228
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:05,600
- Got a door don't work? What's going on?
- Get them waters. Get the cold waters.

1229
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:08,056
We don't need any water.
Get my ring so I can get out of here.

1230
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:11,039
- Get him his ring. He got shit to do.
- The ring, the ring.

1231
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,952
- My ring.
- He's got a game.

1232
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:17,000
Oh, my God. No!
I left the fucking ring in Long Island.

1233
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:18,912
What the fuck do you mean?

1234
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:22,029
- I'll give it to Demany.
- I don't have time for this.

1235
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,117
You'll get it to me?

1236
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,396
Listen, I can't do this.

1237
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:29,200
You don't have to do... I do need...
I know, but I need the stone.

1238
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:31,749
- Do me a favor. You need the stone?
- Yeah, please.

1239
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,656
- Where's my ring at, though?
- I'll get the ring.

1240
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:35,956
I'm gonna give it to Demany.
He'll give it to you.

1241
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:37,918
- Get my ring.
- He'll go to Boston with it.

1242
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,673
Howard, this is bullshit, yo.

1243
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:41,832
Hey, open this fucking door, yo.

1244
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:44,496
- Forgive me for being this fucking...
- Hey, yo, buzz us out, Howard.

1245
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:47,274
- We'll buzz you out. Please, buzz him out.
- This is crazy.

1246
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:51,110
KG, forgive everything I did
and the time I wasted.

1247
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:53,032
You fucking asshole!

1248
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,998
- You fucking did this!
- Yo!

1249
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:58,120
- You! What have you been telling him?
- What the fuck are you talking about?

1250
01:08:58,200 --> 01:08:59,714
Look. This is how the shit works.

1251
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:03,430
I bring niggas here to you to buy jewelry.
That's how I get fucking paid.

1252
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,472
You have a lot of nerve
talking to me right now.

1253
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:08,056
- The fuck are you talking about?
- After that fiasco you fucking caused.

1254
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:11,118
The nigga just offered a quarter of
a million dollars for a fucking rock.

1255
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,317
- That's all me.
- 'Cause of you, huh?

1256
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:15,616
- I had nothing to do with it.
- That's 20 fucking grand I'm out.

1257
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:18,599
You spoke to those guys in Ethiopia,
right? You put all the calls in?

1258
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:20,239
- Yeah, my bad.
- Fuck you, my nigga.

1259
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,277
I'm taking all my niggas somewhere else.

1260
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:25,350
What the fuck are you doing?
Get out of there.

1261
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:27,631
There's only
three fucking watches in here.

1262
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:30,016
- I don't want you in there.
- Where's the rest of my shit?

1263
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:32,919
- I loaned them. I loaned them.
- What you mean, you loaned them?

1264
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:36,078
- These are fake Rollies! So what?
- Nigga, it's my shit, nigga.

1265
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:38,914
Them boxes is mad expensive,
you fucking idiot.

1266
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:42,351
- I owe you then. Get out of here.
- Get the fuck off of me, man.

1267
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:44,176
<i>Howard, I have Dr. Blauman on line one.</i>

1268
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:47,272
- Where the fuck is my shit?
- Go ahead. Go ahead. Hi.

1269
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:50,000
- <i>Howard?</i>
- Hi, Doctor. What's going on?

1270
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:52,056
- <i>Howard.</i>
- Where's the goddamn papers?

1271
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,673
- Please be quiet.
<i>- Is everything okay?</i>

1272
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:56,559
- Where's the fucking papers? Bitch-ass!
- Shut the fuck up.

1273
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:58,911
<i>- Howard, me?</i>
- Go ahead. I'm sorry.

1274
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:01,309
What do I got?

1275
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:04,433
<i>I'm looking at the results
of your colonoscopy.</i>

1276
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:07,096
<i>- You're good. Everything came back clean.</i>
- Bitch-ass motherfucker.

1277
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:10,240
- Fuck you and that goddamn phone call.
- Doctor, so we're clean 100%?

1278
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,756
- You said it's good?
<i>- Yeah, you're all clean.</i>

1279
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:14,718
Good, good. Thank you. That's a relief.

1280
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:17,016
<i>- Relax. This is just routine.</i>
- You ain't fucking listening to me.

1281
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:19,475
My father fucking died from it,
so of course.

1282
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:22,837
<i>I didn't mean to scare you,
but given your family history...</i>

1283
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:26,311
I know, I know.
Jews and colon cancer. What is that?

1284
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,471
I thought we were the chosen people.

1285
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:30,631
<i>Colon cancerjust paid for my house
in the Hamptons.</i>

1286
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:33,235
Don't tell me that. Where?
What part of the Hamptons?

1287
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:34,515
How many acres?

1288
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:36,518
What are you doing?
You're gonna kill the fish.

1289
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:40,111
What the fuck?
My fish! My fish! You fuck!

1290
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:42,398
Get a glass. Get a glass.

1291
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,480
- Fuck them goddamn fish.
- What the fuck are you doing?

1292
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:47,199
You fucking asshole.

1293
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:50,193
Get another glass.
Get another glass. Goddamn it.

1294
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:52,431
Come here. I got you. Cocksucker.

1295
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,950
There you go. There you go.
I got you, sweetheart.

1296
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,874
Joani!
Joani, please get some more glasses.

1297
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:00,270
Can't see the water.
They're blind now.

1298
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,216
<i>All right.
Howard, I'm hanging up.</i>

1299
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:05,995
<i>I thought I was perfectly clear.
5:30, I am out of the door.</i>

1300
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:08,200
I told you I was coming to you,
and I'm coming to you.

1301
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:10,976
- I have the stone. Don't you dare leave.
<i>- I have to leave. I have a wedding.</i>

1302
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,434
Howard. Howard.

1303
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,678
- No!
- Howard. Howard, stop.

1304
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:17,519
You're being fucking crazy again. Stop.

1305
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,398
Listen. I got no time to talk.

1306
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:21,680
I have to be to Adley's
in 15 minutes before they close.

1307
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:24,235
- I'll go with you.
- Then I gotta go through my father-in-law.

1308
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:27,159
Please. I'm really sick.
I got out of bed to come here.

1309
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:30,000
I see you were in a big rush
to come over here, huh?

1310
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:32,117
You got yourself a fucking smoothie.

1311
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:34,436
- I was in a big rush!
- I want you out.

1312
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:36,353
You motherfucker!

1313
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:38,216
Get out of the apartment
by the end of the day.

1314
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:40,709
- Fuck you.
- Out of my life.

1315
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:47,071
You have no idea, but this...

1316
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:05,200
- How you doing, Howie?
- All right.

1317
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,432
<i>- Pesach,</i> Howard.
- All right, Larry.

1318
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:10,193
You're a Jew again? Welcome back.

1319
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:14,511
- I got some diamonds.
- Have a good <i>Pesach.</i>

1320
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:16,552
It's all right. Hi.

1321
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:20,113
This fucking prick.

1322
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:33,830
Dip the celery.

1323
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:50,278
You know who kind of sucks
a little bit, overrated? Chris Paul.

1324
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:52,736
- Chris Paul?
- He's all-NBA, man.

1325
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:54,080
He can't do it alone.

1326
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:56,000
Please, that's enough!

1327
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:00,031
- Shut up, everybody!
- All right. All right.

1328
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:02,760
- Shh. Please.
- Natalie, Natalie, you're up.

1329
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:04,240
Wait, you skipped my dad.

1330
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:06,994
Uh, where are we?

1331
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:09,794
Howard, why don't you read the plagues?

1332
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:14,630
Okay.

1333
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:17,758
Ma, you take the Hebrew,
and I'll take the English.

1334
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:21,317
Yes, my dear. Here we go.

1335
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:25,280
Blood.

1336
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:28,240
Frogs.

1337
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:31,120
Lice.

1338
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,036
Wild animals.

1339
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:37,200
Pestilence.

1340
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:40,560
Boils.

1341
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:43,480
Hail.

1342
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:46,200
Locusts.

1343
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:49,510
Darkness.

1344
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,474
Death of the firstborn.

1345
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:55,438
Hard-core back there.

1346
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:01,590
That can still happen
if you don't watch yourselves, kids.

1347
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,576
<i>Hey, it's Julia.
Please don't leave me a message.</i>

1348
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,398
<i>- I don't check this. Text me.</i>
- Excuse me.

1349
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:12,598
You send me something like that
and then you don't pick up your phone?

1350
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,272
Huh? You were fucking with me?

1351
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:21,190
I'm trying to have a nice,
peaceful dinner with my family,

1352
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:24,239
which is something you wouldn't understand
because you don't have one.

1353
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:26,198
You want to play mind games with me?

1354
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:27,316
Huh?

1355
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,037
So whatever you meant by your little link,

1356
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:33,955
I meant when I said
I want you out of my apartment tonight.

1357
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:40,235
And I want confirmation by text.
Not a link. Via text.

1358
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:43,438
"Howie, I am gone, 10:00 p.m."

1359
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,273
Don't you fucking call me.

1360
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:55,239
Arno, what the fuck?
Can we just fucking talk?

1361
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:58,313
- We're family. We're here right now.
- Get out of my way.

1362
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:01,000
You're not so tough
without your friends around, are you?

1363
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,673
Are you? Are you?

1364
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,473
Fucking pussy.

1365
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,313
You love this roster?

1366
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:10,830
- I love it.
- Baron Davis is done.

1367
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:12,832
Start fresh. Melo, Amar'e.

1368
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:14,280
- What about Lin?
- That's it.

1369
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:15,360
We got to bring back Lin.

1370
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,796
You know why fucking Lin's
not coming back next year?

1371
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:20,679
Because Dolan saw everybody was
so fucking happy. "How can I lose?"

1372
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,917
Howard fucking knows.
On top of which,

1373
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:25,920
you realize that I met my wife
at the first game that started Linsanity?

1374
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:27,954
You know what he says to me?

1375
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:31,351
He comes over to me,
he says, "Happy holidays."

1376
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:32,954
Like it's Christmas.

1377
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:35,671
It's like having an intruder
in your own home.

1378
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:39,753
He's not bothering anybody.
All right? He's trying.

1379
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:41,880
Easy for you to say.
He didn't marry your daughter.

1380
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:48,040
There he is.

1381
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:49,720
You good?

1382
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:52,040
He's got a sprained ankle.
Your guy is a schmuck.

1383
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:55,359
Man, KG wouldn't even
dare mess with Amar'e.

1384
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,911
This is KG, huh?

1385
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:05,396
Three for 11? What the fuck?

1386
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:06,596
Yeah. He looks tortured.

1387
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:09,036
That fucking guy tried
to steal an opal from me.

1388
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:11,755
- Your opal came?
- My opal came, yeah.

1389
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:14,111
And, stupidly,
I lent it to this motherfucker.

1390
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:17,318
- No! He took it? He stole it?
- He didn't steal it.

1391
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:20,194
He got carried away.
He thinks it has magic powers to help him.

1392
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:21,674
Magic powers?

1393
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:24,679
- Yeah.
- No, really?

1394
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:26,558
Look at him tonight without it.

1395
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:29,036
He didn't have it tonight.
Look how fucking bad he played.

1396
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:34,115
He wants to own it, so I tell him
come to the auction and make a bid for it.

1397
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:36,835
- When is this auction?
- The auction is Monday.

1398
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,036
Okay.
So, what do you think it's worth?

1399
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:43,870
Well, listen, it's anywhere
from $1,000 to $3,000 a carat,

1400
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:46,679
and it's 600 carats.

1401
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:48,240
That's over $1 million.

1402
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:50,400
He's rich!

1403
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:53,911
Not as rich as Gooey,
but working on that.

1404
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,754
Who's comparing? Rich is rich.

1405
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:01,193
I made a crazy risk, a gamble,
and it's about to pay off.

1406
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:11,474
Don't look at us. Don't look at him.
Don't look at me. Find it yourself.

1407
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,360
Come on. Keep looking.

1408
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:16,035
Now warm, warm, warm. Warmer.

1409
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:18,675
Very warm.

1410
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:20,399
Keep looking. Keep looking.

1411
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:22,794
I found it!

1412
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:25,151
That's my boy!

1413
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:31,357
Hey, find your stuff. We're leaving soon.

1414
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:32,590
I can't believe...

1415
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:34,640
Just suck in a little bit,
and it'll fit.

1416
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:37,076
- Let's show Dad.
- Dad, Dad, look!

1417
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,914
This is Mom's bat mitzvah dress.
It still fits her.

1418
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,356
Oh! That's hysterical.

1419
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:45,592
Hey. It's 9:00. What do you think?
Should we get going?

1420
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:48,599
- Yeah, let's go tell the boys.
- I told them. I told them.

1421
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:54,160
What?

1422
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:56,471
Um... You look gorgeous.

1423
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:57,600
Oh, God.

1424
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:04,840
I wanted to talk to you for a minute
and just sit down.

1425
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:09,190
We don't have to do it here.
We'll wait, but I...

1426
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:13,115
I'm having very serious
second thoughts.

1427
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:14,520
And, uh...

1428
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:19,992
We're all together right now.
We're all so comfortable.

1429
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,480
It's... I...

1430
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:24,075
Is it too late? Should we maybe...

1431
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:28,711
- What do you think? Am I crazy?
- Are you serious right now?

1432
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:31,480
Yeah. I know. I know I fucked up.

1433
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:33,313
Yeah, you fucked up.
You are a fuck-up.

1434
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:36,120
- And I'm not having this conversation.
- Please, stop.

1435
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:38,635
Just stop for one second.
Just look at me.

1436
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:41,832
Look in my eyes,
and they'll tell you what I'm feeling.

1437
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:43,513
Please. Please.

1438
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:58,273
Okay. What are you thinking?

1439
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:00,514
What? Tell me.

1440
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,438
- Tell me. I want to know.
- Oh, my God.

1441
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:03,715
I know. What?

1442
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:07,274
Your face is so stupid.

1443
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:11,999
- Okay.
- Oh, my God.

1444
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:15,039
I'm gonna leave her.
I'll leave her. I don't need her.

1445
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:16,829
We're done. We're done.

1446
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:19,958
- Okay. Okay.
- It's done. It was stupid. She was trash.

1447
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:23,996
She's trash. I know that.

1448
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:27,160
I was stupid. I'm done. I'm done.

1449
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:29,511
It means nothing. Meant nothing.

1450
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:30,994
Please.

1451
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:33,999
I'm begging you.
Just give me another shot.

1452
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:39,839
- You know what, Howard?
- Say yes. What?

1453
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:43,677
I think you are the most annoying person
I have ever met.

1454
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:47,034
I hate being with you,
I hate looking at you,

1455
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:50,511
and if I had my way
I would never see you again.

1456
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:55,117
That's 'cause you're mad.
You're mad, and it makes sense.

1457
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:57,918
You can punch me if you want.

1458
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Oh, thanks.

1459
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:02,834
Hey! I was ready for it.

1460
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:04,752
I don't even want to touch you.

1461
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:07,190
- Oh, my God!
- Are you kidding me?

1462
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:08,896
Wait, turn around.
I wanna see the back.

1463
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:10,115
Did you see that?

1464
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:12,875
I hate you! Does that fit you right now?

1465
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,753
I'm 15 pounds overweight.

1466
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:18,155
I'll get the car, okay? I'll get the car.

1467
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:20,040
See?

1468
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:22,310
You look so good.

1469
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:25,199
<i>New York and Long Island's
home of classic rock,</i>

1470
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:28,313
<i>Q106. 7, The Rock.</i>

1471
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:30,318
Marcel, she's always...

1472
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,720
Like we want to see everything
she's doing at every moment.

1473
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:35,514
- She's so jealous of you.
- You think she's jealous of me?

1474
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:37,757
Yeah, she wants your life.

1475
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:39,991
- She wants our house.
- She can have it.

1476
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:41,736
Look at the way you're playing.
Go right.

1477
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:43,194
Why are you taking Lex?

1478
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:45,556
I'm gonna take the tunnel.
It's better, less traffic.

1479
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:47,496
No! You let me focus
and give me the phone!

1480
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:50,991
Plus, I want to grab something
from the apartment, and it's right there.

1481
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:53,879
- Go left. Go left.
- I'm trying. I'm trying.

1482
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:57,918
- Hit the boss!
- I hit him.

1483
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:01,033
- We're gonna stop by the apartment, guys.
- Oh, my God.

1484
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:04,397
- Come on, Mom.
- Daddy's got things to do.

1485
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,520
- You're so annoying.
- He's got business.

1486
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:12,190
- You died! Give it to me!
- Oh!

1487
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,671
Hi, Mr. Ratner. How are you?

1488
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:24,559
- Anything in the trunk?
- I'm just gonna be up and down.

1489
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:27,434
- I got to use the bathroom.
- Just hold it in. All right?

1490
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:29,496
- It's 25 minutes before we're home.
- Don't be ridiculous.

1491
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:32,056
- Go upstairs and use the bathroom.
- I'm tired. I wanna go to sleep.

1492
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:35,471
You couldn't go at Grandpa's?
You had to wait till now?

1493
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:38,352
Come on. We're going. We're going.

1494
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:40,955
Goddamn it.

1495
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:47,591
Bathroom is all fucked up because of
construction, so I asked the neighbor if...

1496
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:49,816
I don't wanna use the neighbor's bathroom.
I'm taking a shit.

1497
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:51,638
- You ever see the show <i>Good Times</i>?
- No.

1498
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:54,496
You're actually going to like this.
This guy was the father on the show.

1499
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:56,034
What? I don't care.

1500
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:57,753
I showed it to you.

1501
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:02,679
- He was in <i>Coming to America.</i>
- He's probably sleeping.

1502
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:05,150
- I bet you he's a old man.
- Who is it?

1503
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:07,800
It's Howard, next door. I live in E.

1504
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:13,437
- Hey, how are you?
- What's up?

1505
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:16,712
Unfortunately my bathroom
is all fucked up, and this kid's gotta go.

1506
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,120
Can we use yours for a minute?

1507
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,474
No. Sorry.

1508
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:23,079
What a fucking dickhead.

1509
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:24,958
Hey, stop that.
He's a fucking legend.

1510
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:29,512
- Hello?
- Hi.

1511
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:31,159
I'm your neighbor.

1512
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:33,194
- Hey, how you doing?
- How are you?

1513
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:34,816
I'm your neighbor.
I never introduced myself.

1514
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:36,911
- Alan. How are you?
- My bathroom is all fucked up.

1515
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,913
My son needs to...
Can he use yours for a second?

1516
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,559
Number one or number two?

1517
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:44,320
He's gonna go one. One.
All right? So you go quick.

1518
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:47,438
- All right. In the back.
- I'll meet you in the hallway.

- Did you get what you needed?
- Yeah.

1541
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:35,096
Put the recycling
and the garbage out

1542

1544

Magnolia Bakery
from the downtown original.

1545
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:47,816
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Have you had these yet? Delicious.

1546
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:51,117
You tell everybody here thank you so much
for everything they've done for me.

1547
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:53,510
These are on me, Howard Ratner.

1548
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:54,875
And what's this?

1549
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,913
- Is this the catalog for today?
- That's the one.

1550
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:01,238
If they want anybody else to come in,
they're gonna have to tell me before him.

1551
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:03,394
It stops right on me.

1552
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:04,520
Thank you.

1553
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,153
What the fuck is this?

1554
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:12,636
- This is a mistake.
- It's a correction.

1555
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:15,440
No, it's a correction,
but it's a fucking mistake.

1556
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:18,592
- Where's Anne? I want to speak with her.
- I'm sorry. Anne is in a meeting.

1557
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:21,600
No, get her out of the meeting.
It's an emergency. I wanna speak with her.

1558
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:25,510
Call her on the phone, please. Thank you.

1559
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:30,276
If you promise to keep your voice down,

1560
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:31,874
- I'm happy to call her.
- Yes.

1561
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:34,111
Jesus fucking Christ.

1562
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:36,949
Hello, Anne.

1563
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:40,118
Can you ask her how
this fucking 155 bullshit happened?

1564
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:43,119
Did you hear that? Mm-hmm. Okay.

1565
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:45,471
What? What is she saying?

1566
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,640
- I'm afraid that's your appraisal.
- I know that's what it says.

1567
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:51,280
I'm asking, who came up
with the fucking figure?

1568
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:54,000
- Oscar in Gems.
- Well, Oscar is fucking wrong.

1569
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:57,158
I could go out and get
six appraisers right now,

1570
01:27:57,240 --> 01:27:59,960
five of them would say
at least $3,000 a carat.

1571
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:02,336
- He's saying he can go to six appraisers...
- Give me the phone.

1572
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:03,760
Can I speak to her, please?

1573
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:06,679
- Can I speak with her?
- I'm gonna have to hand you over.

1574
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:08,816
<i>That won't be necessary.
I'd rather you didn't.</i>

1575
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:09,876
- Anne.
<i>- Yes.</i>

1576
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:11,553
This is fucking outrageous.

1577
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:13,576
<i>Okay, you need to calm
yourself down, Mr. Ratner.</i>

1578
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:17,560
I don't want to be calm.
This appraisal is a fucking joke.

1579
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:20,439
<i>Oscar happens to be
one of our most experienced gemologists.</i>

1580
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:22,870
Who clearly knows nothing
about colored stones.

1581
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:24,952
And why the fuck
am I hearing about it now?

1582
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:28,192
<i>Do I need to remind you that you
brought the opal to us on a Friday night</i>

1583
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:29,880
<i>for an auction set on a Monday morning?</i>

1584
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:32,936
<i>- We were lucky to get it appraised at all.</i>
- I don't give a fuck. I don't care.

1585
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:35,136
- It needs to be changed. Do it.
<i>- Well, that's not an option.</i>

1586
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:37,880
<i>- But if you like, we can pull it.</i>
- Pull it? No, no.

1587
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:40,430
Not gonna pull it, okay?
Here's what you'll do.

1588
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:43,234
You're gonna make an announcement
at the top of the auction

1589
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:47,519
that the correction was wrong
and the original estimate stands.

1590
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:51,833
<i>We are not correcting a correction.
We can either pull it or carry on as-is.</i>

1591
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:53,856
<i>- It's entirely up to you.</i>
- Okay. Thank you so much.

1592
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:56,236
- Okay, Anne.
<i>- I have bent over backwards for you.</i>

1593
01:28:56,360 --> 01:28:58,136
<i>- We are done here.</i>
- Yes, that'll be perfect.

1594
01:28:58,160 --> 01:28:59,879
- I'll let her know.
<i>- Let who know?</i>

1595
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:02,998
<i>Me and my staff had to work the entire
weekend to get your piece ready.</i>

1596
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:05,576
<i>- I don't even care what we stand to make.</i>
- Once again, I apologize.

1597
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:08,832
<i>I'm just happy I won't ever
have to work with you again.</i>

1598
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:12,237
So she said that we need to...

1599
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:17,193
take the inserts out of each catalog
before the auction starts.

1600
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:19,476
So you have those.

1601
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:22,598
If you want, I saw a box down there,
and I can start on these.

1602
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:29,240
- What are you doing?
- I just have a question for Anne.

1603
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:31,471
You don't need to call her.
I just spoke with her.

1604
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,831
- It's a separate question. Don't worry.
- Howard!

1605
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:36,714
Hi, Anne. He's saying you told him
it was okay to take out the...

1606
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:39,235
Fuck 'em. Put 'em back in.
I don't give a shit.

1607
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:41,039
- Gooey!
- We're here.

1608
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,952
You're a sight for sore eyes.

1609
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:46,158
- Is he here?
- KG? He is...

1610
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:49,631
- I didn't see him yet.
- I got all these things for him to sign.

1611
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:50,989
Listen to me. Listen.

1612
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:54,039
If you want that,
get it before the auction starts.

1613
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:56,760
- Go to the auction room.
- Find him in there.

1614
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:58,296
He's a great guy.
You'll love him.

1615
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:01,154
- He's excited.
- So, I want to ask you a little favor.

1616
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:03,317
- Yeah, what? What favor?
- So, um...

1617
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:06,393
I need you to jack up the bids.

1618
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:09,756
What? No. No. Absolutely not.

1619
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:12,640
Gooey, a little bit.
It's just here and there, you make a bid.

1620
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:15,753
I just got to ensure we get it up to 250.

1621
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:20,672
- What if I win at 250?
- That's easy. I'll give it back to you.

1622
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:22,638
- But you're not...
- Geez!

1623
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:27,754
This is not a nice position you put me in.
I resent this very much.

1624
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:30,440
I fucked up.
I should've got my own appraisal,

1625
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:32,398
but I didn't have the time.

1626
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:34,591
- How much they appraise it for?
- 200.

1627
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:36,552
- Two hundred?
- Yeah, but these assholes...

1628
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:39,030
- What happened to...
- They don't have an opal specialist.

1629
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:43,837
My guy at the AGL says 500
just based off the pictures.

1630
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:48,631
So, 20% I'll give you for the winning bid,
to be a partner with me.

1631
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:53,676
KG is gonna buy it. It's not a problem.
This guy is obsessed with the stone.

1632
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:57,595
Today was supposed to be
about Aaron meeting KG.

1633
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:00,360
To show support. That's what today
was supposed to be about.

1634
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:03,200
Well, this is support.
This is support like you've never known.

1635
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:06,480
Sold to you. Thank you so much, sir.

1636
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:12,036
We move on now, ladies and gentlemen,
to lot number 38. Lot 38.

1637
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:14,353
We have a sale-room notice.

1638
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:18,750
I'm required to inform you all
that this fine Ethiopian black opal,

1639
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:21,594
presented here before you all
on your left, my right,

1640
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:23,592
is now offered
with a revised estimate

1641
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:28,511
of $155,000 to $225,000 US.

1642
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:32,759
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is a fine piece, a collector's work,

1643
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:36,191
and most importantly,
it is windowed on either side

1644
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:39,717
to reveal the full spectrum
of its dazzling color

1645
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:42,440
and the pinfire pattern within.

1646
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:44,432
So with that in mind,
ladies and gentlemen,

1647
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:46,416
my colleagues are ready
and poised on the phones,

1648
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:48,000
and you're all ready with your paddles.

1649
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:51,552
We shall start the bidding now at $20,000.

1650
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:53,717
20,000 now. 30,000.

1651
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:56,639
Do I have 40,000?
40,000. Gentleman's bid.

1652
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:58,256
Pleasure to see you, sir. Thank you, sir.

1653
01:31:58,280 --> 01:32:00,715
40,000 now. Do I see 50?

1654
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:04,151
50,000 now, in a new place. Thank you.
Pleasure to have you back, too, sir.

1655
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:07,352
50,000 now against you, sir.
Shall we say 60?

1656
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:10,433
60,000 now against you, sir.
70,000 now against you, sir.

1657
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:14,477
- 100 grand.
- 100,000 now.

1658
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:16,472
Bid with you, sir,
and a great place.

1659
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:21,237
A big, bold, giant leap for
a big, bold, giant leaper at 100,000 now.

1660
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:23,789
It's no longer yours, sir.
It's against you, sir.

1661
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:25,320
Going to try one more, sir?

1662
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:27,232
I will even break an increment
with you, sir.

1663
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:30,194
Can I urge you to consider
a bid of 105,000, sir?

1664
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:31,919
Come on, sir. Are you sure?

1665
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:35,679
Positive? No further?
A defiant nod then.

1666
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:40,400
Looking then for 110, the room.
It's 100,000 now.

1667
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:42,671
Is there any further bidding?
110,000 now.

1668
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:46,237
Welcome back, sir. 110,000 now.
Once again against you, sir.

1669
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:48,073
Shall we try 120? 120.

1670
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:52,277
Try one more, sir?
Let's try 130. 130 now.

1671
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:54,750
Try 140? 140,000.

1672
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:57,470
Come on, sir.
Let's up it again to 150.

1673
01:32:57,960 --> 01:33:00,953
Try one more and 150,000.
No longer yours, sir.

1674
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:03,197
Would you try 160? 160 now.

1675
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:07,640
Back against you again, sir.
Can we try one more at 170?

1676
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:10,072
170 now. Say 180.

1677
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:13,031
- Say 180, sir.
- We agreed on 175.

1678
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:15,032
- $180,000 now.
- It's fine.

1679
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:16,799
Bid back against you, sir.

1680
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:19,073
I'm looking for 190,000.

1681
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:24,273
$190,000 is bid.
Against you, sir.

1682
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:28,559
190,000.
Confer with your adviser now.

1683
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:32,991
It's okay. I need this stone.

1684
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:35,151
Gonna move this up any higher,
any further?

1685
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:38,074
- Relax. Are you serious?
- It's a last chance for you, sir.

1686
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:41,272
I have to move this along.
We have a good bid at 190,000.

1687
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:43,679
I'm looking for 200, sir.

1688
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:48,472
Gonna move this up
any higher, any further?

1689
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:54,111
You sure, sir? Last chance, fair warning.

1690
01:33:54,240 --> 01:33:58,632
It's with you, sir, at $190,000,
against the phones,

1691
01:33:58,760 --> 01:34:00,114
against the rest of the room.

1692
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:05,431
Sold to you, sir, at $190,000.
Thank you so much.

1693
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:08,837
Thank you, sir. Paddle 172.

1694
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:16,675
All right. Hmm?

1695
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:19,719
- Gooey, I'm so goddamn sorry.
- Shh!

1696
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:21,680
Thank you very much.

1697
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:23,234
I'm sorry.

1698
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:24,840
Listen. I...

1699
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:28,951
- Supposed to be on 48th street.
- Thank you. Thank you.

1700
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:33,233
- It's 190 grand, Howard.
- That's temporary. That's temporary.

1701
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:35,073
Hey, I'm sorry.

1702
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:38,551
I gotta tell you I was gonna stop
pressing him once we got past 200,000.

1703
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:40,536
- Did I not tell you that was gonna happen?
- I'm sorry.

1704
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:44,076
- So now what?
- Your money is gonna go into my account.

1705
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:46,709
- I'll wire it right back to you.
- Including you owe me 20%.

1706
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:48,496
Absolutely.
It comes right out of my pocket.

1707
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:51,354
- That is nearly 38 grand, Howard.
- I know that.

1708
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:55,480
So I'm gonna need a couple weeks on that,
but it'll be done. I promise you.

1709
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:58,016
- Aaron, let's go. Come on.
- Dad, I got, like, six autographs.

1710
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:00,157
- Now.
- See you, Gooey.

1711
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:02,456
You got the autographs.
That's great.

1712
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:04,233
Yeah, great.

1713
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:05,959
Wasn't Garnett a champ?

1714
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:09,829
Hey, don't be mad at me, okay?
Please? Please don't be mad.

1715
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:14,080
Come on. Can I get the opal?
Let me get the opal.

1716
01:35:14,160 --> 01:35:16,072
- What for?
- Because I gotta sell that.

1717
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:18,950
- Take the fucking opal.
- Yes, all right. Okay, thanks.

1718
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:23,594
Get them going. Open the fucking door.
What's he waiting for you for?

1719
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:26,439
Okay. All right.

1720
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:30,799
I know, I know, I know.

1721
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:33,710
Let him go, and then we'll talk.

1722
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:36,315
- The fuck was that?
- All right, I fucked up.

1723
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:39,393
It was a mistake, all right?
I know it. I admit it.

1724
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:40,874
I gotta... I gotta...

1725
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:43,350
Let's hit pause for one fucking second.

1726
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:46,757
Gonna call Kevin
'cause I know he fucking wants it.

1727
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:49,719
And you saw he's got the 175.

1728
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:52,395
And then everything will be copacetic.

1729
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:53,480
All right?

1730
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:57,392
KG, it's me. I got great news for you.

1731
01:35:58,200 --> 01:35:59,200
Hello?

1732
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:01,990
Hello?

1733
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:04,390
There's no one on the fucking phone.

1734
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:06,553
If you just give me two fucking...

1735
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:08,393
Shut the fuck up.

1736
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:11,160
You're lucky there's people
around here, you prick. Let's go.

1737
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:12,833
Hey, you fucking...

1738
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:26,800
Hey.

1739
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:30,311
Arno! Arno!

1740
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:31,993
Just listen to me, please.

1741
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:34,754
I spoke to Demany.

1742
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:37,514
Remember Demany?
He's a business friend of mine.

1743
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:39,319
He gave me the fucking number.

1744
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:41,551
Enough, Howard! That's fucking enough!

1745
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:43,757
Why are you being so thick-headed and...

1746
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:48,078
Fuck you, man. Suck my dick.
Throw him in the fucking water.

1747
01:36:49,480 --> 01:36:50,576
Come on. Let's get outta here.

1748
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:52,557
Let's go. Fuck him. Let's go.
Come on.

1749
01:37:03,720 --> 01:37:05,234
Where the fuck are my glasses?

1750
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:08,032
Oh, my fucking God. Where are they?

1751
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:48,200
Got the Versace.

1752
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:52,439
I don't know if this is a $400 bag.
Maybe 250.

1753
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:54,113
Howard! Howard!

1754
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:57,153
Forget about Howard.
The Brioni's great on you.

1755
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:26,016
- <i>Howard, Joseph and...</i>
- I'm not feeling good.

1756
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:28,600
<i>- Are you okay? What's wrong?</i>
- I don't want to work.

1757
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:30,677
- Send everybody home.
<i>- All right, sweetie.</i>

1758
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:13,552
Hey. Sorry to bother you.

1759
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:15,156
What is it?

1760
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:17,433
I wanted to see how the auction went.

1761
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:21,031
Terrible.
I don't want to talk about it.

1762
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:25,512
Okay, well, Damien and Joseph
brought this amazing sweat suit

1763
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:27,478
that I think would look so nice on you.

1764
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:30,155
- Do you want to see it?
- Just leave me alone, please.

1765
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:32,234
Come on, Howard.

1766
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:36,239
Don't look at me.

1767
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:37,589
Oh, my God, Howard.

1768
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:40,831
- Don't look at me.
- What the fuck happened to you?

1769
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:42,673
Don't look at me, please.

1770
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:50,790
I don't know what I'm thinking.
I don't know what everybody is...

1771
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:53,312
It's not ever going right.

1772
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:54,993
I know. I know.

1773
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:56,480
I'm so sad.

1774
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:58,199
I'm so fucked up.

1775
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:00,871
I'm so fucked up.

1776
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:03,077
Hey, I'm really upset, too.

1777
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:09,111
I'm sorry if this has
anything to do with me,

1778
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:11,157
but I swear I didn't do anything.

1779
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:13,709
I wish you were nicer to me though.

1780
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:17,032
It was not nice what you did to me.

1781
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:19,197
I try, but it's really hard.

1782
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:21,795
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

1783
01:40:21,880 --> 01:40:25,669
I don't have any place to go.
I don't have anywhere to get better.

1784
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:27,638
But you do.

1785
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:29,359
Like, really, Howard.

1786
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,151
You're my home.
You could come to me.

1787
01:40:32,240 --> 01:40:34,709
I can't figure out...

1788
01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:37,551
I can't figure out
what I'm supposed to do.

1789
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:41,793
Everything I do, it's not going right.
Everything I do, it's not going right.

1790
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:43,840
I don't know what to do. I really don't.

1791
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:46,839
And I don't want anymore of this shit.
I really don't.

1792
01:40:46,920 --> 01:40:50,391
I gotta figure this out.
I gotta figure this out. I really do.

1793
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:55,230
Well, I got something if you want,
but you can't make fun of me.

1794
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:56,396
What?

1795
01:40:57,800 --> 01:41:01,111
My God, it's so stupid, but...
I don't know. I got it.

1796
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:03,550
I thought it would make you feel better.

1797
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:05,233
Look. Unzip my skirt.

1798
01:41:07,880 --> 01:41:10,270
Not like that. JJust unzip my skirt.

1799
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:16,431
- It says "Howie."
- What did you do?

1800
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:19,194
- Why would you do that?
- You don't like it?

1801
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:22,751
- No, I do. I'm not worth it.
- Yes, you are.

1802
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:24,951
You are worth it. Look, Howie.

1803
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:26,736
- I'm so crazy about you.
- I don't deserve this.

1804
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:28,638
Yes, you do. I love you.

1805
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:30,279
- No, no.
- Yeah.

1806
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:33,592
- You can't even get buried with me now.
- It's okay.

1807
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:39,955
This fucking guy.

1808
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:42,555
Do not let him in. Understand me?

1809
01:41:42,640 --> 01:41:44,518
Just ignore him. Ignore him, Joey.

1810
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:52,270
Here. Let's get you cleaned up.

1811
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:55,637
It's not broken, right?
You don't think it's broken, right?

1812
01:41:56,960 --> 01:41:59,794
This is crazy.
You can't be out here looking like this.

1813
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:08,520
Can you answer that?

1814
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:12,072
- Hello?
<i>- Hi. This is Liz. I work with Kevin.</i>

1815
01:42:12,160 --> 01:42:15,073
<i>- I'm actually looking for Howard.</i>
- This is Howard.

1816
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:18,551
Hi. Yes, I got your message
from Demany about the gem.

1817
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:20,120
We're at the bank right now.

1818
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:23,511
Oh. Did... So, does he want it?

1819
01:42:23,640 --> 01:42:26,439
<i>Yes, yes. Kevin's still interested.
We could actually be...</i>

1820
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:28,239
It's like we discussed, right?

1821
01:42:28,360 --> 01:42:31,876
It's still 175, right?

1822
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:33,997
<i>- Yes. Yes, in cash.</i>
- In cash?

1823
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:35,976
<i>- We're at the bank.
- You tell him we're at the bank?</i>

1824
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,719
<i>Kevin, yes. I told him.</i>

1825
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:39,314
<i>- Howard, I got to go.</i>
- Okay, okay.

1826
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:41,039
<i>I'll see you soon. Goodbye.</i>

1827
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:44,512
You see? I told you.

1828
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:47,956
Arno, listen. No bullshit.

1829
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:55,510
Kevin Garnett is coming to my office
right now with $175,000 cash, all right?

1830
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:57,353
You said I got till Monday?

1831
01:42:57,480 --> 01:42:58,630
Today is still Monday,

1832
01:42:58,720 --> 01:43:02,634
so I don't know if you're hearing this,
but, Arno, this is real.

1833
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:05,792
Kevin's really on the way.
He was just at the bank.

1834
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:07,553
Come get your money, buddy.

1835
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:09,880
- I need the Celtic ring back.
- What happened to Friday?

1836
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:11,718
- I know, I know.
- It's Monday, Howie.

1837
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:14,594
I know what we said.
But it was a short week. <i>Pesach.</i>

1838
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:18,919
- What happened to your face?
- Car accident, okay?

1839
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:23,313
So, listen to me. I need the Celtic ring.
I'm gonna give you the Knicks ring.

1840
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:26,751
All right? You know what that means to me.
Swap them out, please.

1841
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:30,151
- You've had this Knicks ring forever.
- I just need the Celtic ring back.

1842
01:43:30,240 --> 01:43:32,436
- All right?
- No, no.

1843
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:34,616
- What do you want to do?
- I own that ring right now.

1844
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:37,280
- I know you do.
- So, I'll swap you the two rings.

1845
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:40,034
But I'm gonna put a 15% vig on this one.

1846
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:42,376
If you're not here by Friday,
it's gonna be the same thing.

1847
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:44,896
- You're not gonna have a third ring.
- You're not gonna have to worry.

1848
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:47,560
Make it a 16%.
I'm sorry I fucked you.

1849
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:49,313
What's going on? You okay?

1850
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:51,830
- I'm very good. Everything is going good.
- Yeah?

1851
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:54,276
I promise you. I promise you.

1852
01:43:59,240 --> 01:44:01,436
Hey, there he is.

1853
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:04,080
KG, don't you got a game tonight?

1854
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:08,078
I got your chip right here, all right?
Game night.

1855
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:09,992
- We've really got to go.
- You must be Liz.

1856
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:11,992
We're gonna make it quick. Absolutely.

1857
01:44:13,361 --> 01:44:16,513
Julia, let's get these guys
some Powerades.

1858
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:19,195
Powerades? Water? Anything else?

1859
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:22,193
- It's fine. I'm okay. I'm good.
- They're cold. You know that.

1860
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:25,233
- Let me get a second with you.
- You want a second? Sure.

1861
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:29,110
- Kevin, five minutes.
- I got it. Give me two seconds.

1862
01:44:29,240 --> 01:44:30,976
Kevin, we need to be there
in less than an hour.

1863
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,151
Let me holler at you.
What the fuck is going on?

1864
01:44:33,240 --> 01:44:36,160
Ever since I met you, you've been
giving me the runaround with everything.

1865
01:44:36,240 --> 01:44:39,438
- What do you mean?
- You're fucking with my emotions.

1866
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:42,712
You just playing with me. This hasn't
been straight since I came here.

1867
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:44,216
- You understand?
- Why you saying that?

1868
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:47,176
I borrowed the opal. It's just one thing.
I come back over here. I brought it back.

1869
01:44:47,200 --> 01:44:49,556
I brought it back. I didn't have to.
You understand?

1870
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:53,429
I show up at the auction, you had somebody
bid against me? All these fucking games.

1871
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:57,355
What the fuck are you doing?
You don't think I know none of this?

1872
01:44:57,440 --> 01:44:59,591
It's complicated, KG.

1873
01:44:59,680 --> 01:45:01,751
You see this face? You see this?

1874
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:04,230
Here's 165,000 right here, cash.

1875
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:06,437
I'm showing you
because it wasn't easy, man.

1876
01:45:06,520 --> 01:45:08,876
Six percent goes to Demany.
I've already taken it out.

1877
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,514
All right. I guess that's fair.

1878
01:45:10,640 --> 01:45:12,791
Let me get the fucking opal.
Let me get out of here.

1879
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:15,435
This opal.
This opal is very valuable for you.

1880
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:17,159
- Absolutely.
- Okay? I did that.

1881
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:19,154
Get the fuck out.

1882
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:23,160
I respect you. I respect your passion.
Okay? I always have.

1883
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:26,079
- I thought you was a fan, too, man.
- I'm a fucking huge fan.

1884
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:28,795
What did you pay for this? Real shit.

1885
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:31,037
That's not a fair question, Kevin.
All right?

1886
01:45:31,120 --> 01:45:34,192
We're talking months
and months of my time.

1887
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:36,994
I'm not gonna take the money back.
I did the deal. I'm just saying.

1888
01:45:37,080 --> 01:45:39,595
Straight up, me and you, mano a mano.

1889
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:41,876
- How much did you pay for this?
- Fucking...

1890
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,310
What'd I pay? I paid a...

1891
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:45,800
This is... That's...

1892
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:49,556
I'm telling you, if I answer
that question, it's very misleading.

1893
01:45:49,640 --> 01:45:52,792
- Why?
- I paid 100 grand, okay?

1894
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:56,470
- So you doubled your money.
- I'm the joke here. I got fucked.

1895
01:45:56,560 --> 01:45:59,200
A million dollars
is what I was supposed to get.

1896
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:02,717
I get a-fucking-what? Made 65 G's?

1897
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:05,474
You gave some niggas
from Ethiopia 100 grand

1898
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:07,916
for something you thought
was worth a million dollars.

1899
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,360
- You don't see nothing wrong with that?
- Ethiopian miners?

1900
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:12,198
You know what these guys make?

1901
01:46:12,280 --> 01:46:15,512
A hundred grand
is 50 lifetimes for these guys.

1902
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:17,956
A million dollars is more is my point.

1903
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:21,710
You want to win by one point
or fucking 30 points, KG?

1904
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:25,635
Right? I see you out there when
the fucking stadium is all booing you.

1905
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:28,070
You're 30 up.
You're still going full tilt.

1906
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:33,114
What does Vegas got you guys at today?
Take a look. Let's see.

1907
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:34,430
Are you serious?

1908
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:36,176
- You gonna pull this up here?
- Look at this.

1909
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:39,272
The Sixers are supposed
to win the game tonight, they think.

1910
01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:41,437
I don't keep track of that shit.

1911
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:44,473
They think on game seven
you're not gonna get fucking 18 points.

1912
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:46,296
They don't think
you're going to get eight rebounds?

1913
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:48,736
- These guys don't know shit about ball.
- What the fuck are they do...

1914
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:50,717
Doesn't that make you
want to fucking kill them?

1915
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:53,639
Doesn't that make you want to say,
"Fuck you for doubting me"?

1916
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:58,232
Doesn't that make you want to step
on fucking Elton Brand's fucking neck?

1917
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:01,279
Come on, KG.
This is no different than that.

1918
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:04,512
This is me. All right?
I'm not a fucking athlete.

1919
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:06,990
This is my fucking way.
This is how I win.

1920
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:10,594
All right? All the fucking hard work I do?

1921
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:13,639
All the fucking ass-kicking
and the dues I pay?

1922
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:17,475
You're not gonna score on the big one
on game seven?

1923
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:19,472
Fuck these people, right?

1924
01:47:19,560 --> 01:47:21,677
That's how you feel. I know you do.

1925
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:22,830
So look.

1926
01:47:25,240 --> 01:47:27,277
Let's fucking bet on this.

1927
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:28,840
Let's bet on this shit.

1928
01:47:30,720 --> 01:47:34,555
I'm fucking gonna bet
all this money on you tonight, KG.

1929
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:37,792
You're here to win, KG.
These fuckers don't know.

1930
01:47:37,880 --> 01:47:41,112
Them out fucking west?
Do you think they fucking know you?

1931
01:47:41,200 --> 01:47:43,795
They don't know you.
They don't know us.

1932
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:47,357
It's about fucking winning.
It's about you.

1933
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:50,154
I saw your fucking conviction,

1934
01:47:50,240 --> 01:47:54,439
your fucking honesty
and your fucking magic.

1935
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:57,234
- Howard, you're fucking crazy, man.
- Listen, KG.

1936
01:47:57,360 --> 01:48:00,478
Do you even understand how fucking great
of a game you're gonna have tonight?

1937
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:01,789
- I know it.
- Listen...

1938
01:48:01,880 --> 01:48:04,156
We're a team tonight, KG.

1939
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:05,799
This is a fucking lock.

1940
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:08,310
It's a fucking feeling. We both have it.

1941
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:12,110
They don't know.
You and I know, all right?

1942
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:14,880
- Nice fucking trim.
- There we go.

1943
01:48:18,160 --> 01:48:20,436
Nice fucking watch, too.

1944
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:24,719
Hey, do you mind watching the space
while I run to the bathroom?

1945
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:26,598
- Sure.
- Thank you.

1946
01:48:27,560 --> 01:48:31,440
- I can leave you guys alone in here?
- Do your business. You want company?

1947
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:33,711
I don't think so. But next time maybe.

1948
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:40,958
- Hey. I'm looking for Howard.
- I don't know where he is. I'm sorry.

1949
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:43,000
- We're closed.
- He gave me a fucking fake Rolex.

1950
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:44,416
- I'm sorry.
- I'm not getting stuck with this.

1951
01:48:44,440 --> 01:48:47,797
- I don't know anything about that.
- Well, let me talk to you about this.

1952
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:49,336
- You gotta help me.
- Sorry, I'm busy.

1953
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:52,273
This is gonna be one of
the best nights of our fucking lives.

1954
01:48:52,360 --> 01:48:54,158
Howard. Howard.

1955
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:02,799
Come on. Come on.

1956
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:04,951
Come on. Come on. Where are you?

1957
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:07,216
- Howard, what the fuck is going on?
- Take this.

1958
01:49:07,240 --> 01:49:09,016
- What is this?
- I need you to listen to me carefully.

1959
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:10,918
I booked you on a Blade, okay?

1960
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,196
You're gonna land on top of
the Mohegan Sun.

1961
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:15,590
- Okay.
- There's a bet in that bag.

1962
01:49:15,680 --> 01:49:17,114
I want you to take all of it,

1963
01:49:17,200 --> 01:49:19,760
all of it inside the bag,
and place it on that bet.

1964
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:21,638
- How much is in the bag?
- There's a lot.

1965
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:23,513
I don't want you to think about that.

1966
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:25,656
I don't even want you to look at it
until you get there

1967
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:27,456
and you take it out
and give it to the teller.

1968
01:49:27,480 --> 01:49:28,936
- You understand me?
- Okay. I got it.

1969
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:31,031
I'm gonna fuck the living
shit out of you tonight.

1970
01:49:31,160 --> 01:49:32,840
- You know that?
- I wish I could kiss you.

1971
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,071
All right, you gotta go.
You get going.

1972
01:49:35,160 --> 01:49:37,038
All right. Love you. Bye.

1973
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:39,991
Thanks, Jo. See you.

1974
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:42,717
Bye. See you, Josh.

1975
01:49:47,360 --> 01:49:49,158
- Let's get this over with.
- Arno.

1976
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:52,714
- You're never gonna believe this shit.
- Believe what?

1977
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:54,951
We're about to hit so goddamn big.

1978
01:49:55,040 --> 01:49:57,350
KG was just here. You saw him, right?

1979
01:49:57,440 --> 01:49:58,669
I gave him the gem.

1980
01:49:58,760 --> 01:50:01,480
He's gonna fuck up the money line
so bad tonight.

1981
01:50:01,560 --> 01:50:03,358
Howard, where's the money right now?

1982
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:06,399
It's on the way right now.
It's on the way to the casino.

1983
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:08,796
What the fuck
are you talking about, Howard?

1984
01:50:08,920 --> 01:50:12,118
- The fuck is going on in there?
- Where's that girl?

1985
01:50:12,200 --> 01:50:13,776
- I ain't seen her.
- She didn't get back here?

1986
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:15,456
- No.
- What are you not getting?

1987
01:50:15,480 --> 01:50:18,120
- No, no. It's in this room right now.
- Go get her now.

1988
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:19,720
Bring her back.

1989
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:21,911
Hey, handsome, hit the buzzer.

1990
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,536
For what?
What am I opening the door for?

1991
01:50:23,560 --> 01:50:25,536
- Somebody fucking just buzz me out.
- I got it.

1992
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:29,236
- What are they doing?
- You're saying what?

1993
01:50:29,320 --> 01:50:32,074
Take your hands off me.
What the fuck are we doing?

1994
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:34,396
It's gonna make sense
in about two fucking minutes.

1995
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:36,870
- You're gonna listen to what...
- I'm listening to you.

1996
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:39,640
- You're gonna do what I tell you to do.
- Listen, you fucking goon.

1997
01:50:39,720 --> 01:50:42,758
I'm telling you something good right now.
Listen to me.

1998
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:53,200
- Shut the fuck up.
- What are you doing?

1999
01:50:57,120 --> 01:50:58,315
Hey! Come on. Come on.

2000
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:05,640
- I'll drop you on your fucking head!
- Give me the word. I'm gonna let him go.

2001
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:07,677
Please, help me up.

2002
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:09,672
- You gonna call her?
- I'll call her!

2003
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:12,376
- Are you gonna get that bitch down here?
- I promise. Take me up.

2004
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:13,920
All right, come on. Get him up.

2005
01:51:16,600 --> 01:51:18,478
Listen. Listen to me.

2006
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:20,870
Get yourself together, all right?

2007
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:24,317
I want you to make that call.
Hear me? Come on.

2008
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:26,357
Give me a fucking second, please.

2009
01:51:26,840 --> 01:51:28,816
You'll have plenty of time
after you make the call.

2010
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:32,595
- My heart.
- Call this girl. I want her back here now.

2011
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:38,359
She's at Mohegan Sun.

2012
01:51:38,440 --> 01:51:40,318
Yeah. Here, come on. Let's go.

2013
01:51:41,720 --> 01:51:42,720
Put it on speaker.

2014
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:48,235
There we go.

2015
01:51:51,720 --> 01:51:53,393
This motherfucker...

2016
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:56,876
Come on. Come on.

2017
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,595
- I can't. I'm sorry.
- Fucking guy. Unbelievable.

2018
01:52:06,680 --> 01:52:09,036
I'm sorry. I really am. I am sorry.

2019
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:15,429
Fuck this.

2020
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:17,910
You're a moron.

2021
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:20,151
- I'll do it.
- Are you kidding me?

2022
01:52:20,240 --> 01:52:22,471
It's not worth it, man.
Put that shit away.

2023
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:24,279
- What are you doing?
- Buzz us out.

2024
01:52:24,360 --> 01:52:26,317
Why am I buzzing you? Why are you going?

2025
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:28,835
- Just buzz me the fuck out.
- Watch the fucking game.

2026
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:31,674
- Buzz me the fuck out.
- You'll be happy with the results.

2027
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:35,071
I'm telling you now before
I put your head through the fucking glass.

2028
01:52:35,160 --> 01:52:37,040
I'll buzz you out.
I'll buzz you out, all right?

2029
01:52:38,160 --> 01:52:39,310
Fucking...

2030
01:52:40,640 --> 01:52:42,313
Close that door. Close it.

2031
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,320
Come on. Buzz me out.

2032
01:52:47,480 --> 01:52:49,233
What are you doing?

2033
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:51,317
Open this fucking door.

2034
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:52,440
Come on.

2035
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:55,456
- This cocksucker...
- Howard, open the door.

2036
01:52:55,480 --> 01:52:56,675
We can't get out.

2037
01:52:57,400 --> 01:53:00,313
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm not buzzing you out.

2038
01:53:00,400 --> 01:53:02,631
Arno. Arno.

2039
01:53:02,760 --> 01:53:05,355
The Sixers shouldn't even be there.
You understand?

2040
01:53:05,440 --> 01:53:08,080
She's at the Mohegan Sun
sports book.

2041
01:53:08,160 --> 01:53:09,753
Mohegan Sun sports book.

2042
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:11,069
This is a game seven.

2043
01:53:11,160 --> 01:53:13,736
- Get over there now.
- You know what she looks like. Find her.

2044
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:16,594
- They're gonna get to the Garden and fold.
- Howard, open the door.

2045
01:53:16,680 --> 01:53:19,070
- I know you're upset, Arno.
- Of course I'm upset.

2046
01:53:19,160 --> 01:53:21,880
I'm trying to fucking
make this all work for you.

2047
01:53:21,960 --> 01:53:26,512
The NBA doesn't want the Sixers to win.
They got... There's no money in that.

2048
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:28,432
You understand?
The refs know that.

2049
01:53:28,520 --> 01:53:32,036
They want stars.
Stars get a fucking rating.

2050
01:53:32,120 --> 01:53:34,430
Open the door! Open it now!

2051
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:36,398
This is fucking bulletproof.

2052
01:53:36,480 --> 01:53:38,631
You're only gonna hurt yourself.
That doesn't work.

2053
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:40,518
- Phil. Phil.
- Arno, I'd duck.

2054
01:53:40,600 --> 01:53:42,796
You're gonna get killed. Listen to me.

2055
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:45,918
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm talking to Arno.

2056
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,071
- Enough of you.
- Open this fucking door!

2057
01:53:48,160 --> 01:53:49,776
- Listen to me.
- I got something.

2058
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:53,430
Do you realize all he's gotta do
is get the opening tip?

2059
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:55,079
Buzz that fucking thing open.

2060
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:57,840
You know how many rebounds
this guy is gonna get?

2061
01:53:58,360 --> 01:54:02,354
Who is that? Who are you talking to?
Who'd you call? Who did you call?

2062
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:05,193
Open the fucking door, dick.

2063
01:54:11,680 --> 01:54:15,196
- Come on. Come on, goddamn it.
- I need you to get over here, man.

2064
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:19,193
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Dinah, it's me.

2065
01:54:19,280 --> 01:54:21,920
<i>- Make it quick, 'cause I...</i>
- ConEd called the office.

2066
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:24,953
There's a fucking gas leak on Pinoak.

2067
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:27,714
<i>- For crying out loud.</i>
- So they're evacuating the whole block.

2068
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:30,190
<i>- Just slow down, okay?</i>
- So get the kids out of there.

2069
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:31,680
You and the kids go to Amy's.

2070
01:54:31,800 --> 01:54:33,473
<i>Why would they call the office and not...</i>

2071
01:54:33,560 --> 01:54:36,519
- I don't know why they called me.
<i>- You're not making any sense.</i>

2072
01:54:36,680 --> 01:54:39,320
I'm not here to argue with you, Dinah.

2073
01:54:39,400 --> 01:54:42,313
Get the kids out of the house.
I'm frightened, okay?

2074
01:54:42,440 --> 01:54:43,536
<i>- You're freaking me out.</i>
- Just get out.

2075
01:54:43,560 --> 01:54:46,314
Go to Amy's and do not leave there
until I get home.

2076
01:54:46,440 --> 01:54:47,840
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>
- You promise me?

2077
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:50,480
- Stay at her house, okay?
<i>- Okay. But you'll meet us there?</i>

2078
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:52,776
- Let me tell you something, prick.
- Yes. Thank you.

2079
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:54,359
Open the fucking door!

2080
01:54:54,840 --> 01:54:57,150
<i>Last year I made $125 million.</i>

2081
01:54:57,240 --> 01:54:59,136
I don't even know what to do
with my money anymore.

2082
01:54:59,160 --> 01:55:00,514
I have nobody to spend it with,

2083
01:55:00,600 --> 01:55:03,115
nobody to enjoy my life with anymore.
It's horrible.

2084
01:55:03,560 --> 01:55:06,314
Today is a big day for me.
I met you. You're hot.

2085
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:07,880
Wanna have a drink when we get there?

2086
01:55:27,080 --> 01:55:31,199
<i>This is the third
of game seven of the 2012 NBA playoffs.</i>

2087
01:55:33,640 --> 01:55:36,075
<i>...it certainly has been competitive.</i>

2088
01:55:39,720 --> 01:55:44,192
- Hi.
- Hey, okay, so I'm betting on the Celtics.

2089
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:47,876
Parlay, three-way, money...
I don't know. Plus tip? Here.

2090
01:55:48,040 --> 01:55:49,599
So you want a parlay, three-way...

2091
01:55:49,680 --> 01:55:51,936
Make sure that when you put it in,
it's exactly that, okay?

2092
01:55:51,960 --> 01:55:53,474
I will. How much you want on it?

2093
01:55:53,560 --> 01:55:56,280
I'm not really sure.
You're just gonna have to...

2094
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:58,119
Oh. Okay.

2095
01:55:58,200 --> 01:56:00,192
Chad? Just give me a minute.

2096
01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:02,198
I just have to have
my supervisor count this.

2097
01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:03,549
- Okay?
- Okay.

2098
01:56:06,200 --> 01:56:08,431
- We're almost there.
- One second, ma'am.

2099
01:56:26,160 --> 01:56:27,560
Come on. Let's go.

2100
01:56:28,760 --> 01:56:30,592
You feeling this?

2101
01:56:30,720 --> 01:56:31,870
Feeling this.

2102
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:34,430
Beautiful.

2103
01:56:36,280 --> 01:56:39,079
- <i>Number 5, KG!</i>
- This is it, boys. This is it.

2104
01:56:39,160 --> 01:56:42,073
<i>Kevin Garnett.</i>

2105
01:56:42,160 --> 01:56:44,436
Go ahead. Tell me.

2106
01:56:46,160 --> 01:56:47,674
Okay. Listen. Listen. Listen.

2107
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:51,117
Say the whole ticket out loud.
I want you to say it really loud.

2108
01:56:51,200 --> 01:56:55,080
Give me a second.
I want some people to hear it. Hang on.

2109
01:56:55,640 --> 01:56:57,120
Say the whole ticket. Go ahead.

2110
01:56:57,280 --> 01:57:00,239
- <i>I put 155 on the three-way bet.</i>
- Yeah.

2111
01:57:00,360 --> 01:57:03,831
<i>Garnett's points plus his rebounds
with the Celtics money line</i>

2112
01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:06,156
<i>with the Celtics to win the opening tip.</i>

2113
01:57:06,240 --> 01:57:09,039
Right.
Just read the whole ticket.

2114
01:57:09,120 --> 01:57:11,476
<i>Okay. So it says here that...</i>

2115
01:57:11,560 --> 01:57:13,392
- You having a good time?
- Yes.

2116
01:57:13,480 --> 01:57:17,076
<i>...to win $1,229,000...</i>

2117
01:57:17,160 --> 01:57:18,753
Did you fucking hear that number?

2118
01:57:18,840 --> 01:57:20,877
That's enough.
You don't have to say anymore.

2119
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:23,759
- The bet's in. The bet's in, okay?
- Fuck you.

2120
01:57:23,880 --> 01:57:27,430
I'm taking you to the Ritz Carlton
in the Grand Cayman, all right?

2121
01:57:27,560 --> 01:57:28,994
With the fucking Jacuzzi.

2122
01:57:29,120 --> 01:57:31,510
- All right. Rub that tattoo for me.
<i>- Okay, I love you.</i>

2123
01:57:32,680 --> 01:57:34,114
Okay, here we go.

2124
01:57:34,240 --> 01:57:37,870
We grab this tip,
and we're in business, boys. All right?

2125
01:57:38,440 --> 01:57:40,432
Pound that chest, baby. This is it.

2126
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:43,759
We got to get this.
This is right out the gate.

2127
01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:45,994
Come on. Come on, man.

2128
01:57:46,600 --> 01:57:47,600
Come on.

2129
01:57:48,920 --> 01:57:50,434
Get that tip.

2130
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:53,115
Let's go.
Get that fucking tip. Get that tip.

2131
01:57:59,440 --> 01:58:02,638
Get that! Yes, yes!

2132
01:58:03,040 --> 01:58:05,396
Fuck! We would've been fucked
if he didn't get that!

2133
01:58:05,480 --> 01:58:09,235
That was the fucking biggest part
of the whole goddamn parlay right there.

2134
01:58:09,320 --> 01:58:12,950
That was huge.
I knew he was gonna win that.

2135
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:15,556
All right. That's it.

2136
01:58:18,400 --> 01:58:21,472
One! One rebound. Go.
That's one. That's fucking one.

2137
01:58:21,560 --> 01:58:24,871
Look at that. Look at that.
Right out the fucking gate. The man.

2138
01:58:24,960 --> 01:58:26,792
The man's feeling this. Yep!

2139
01:58:27,480 --> 01:58:28,960
Go. Get it. Get it to him.

2140
01:58:29,080 --> 01:58:32,118
- <i>Garnett down low.</i>
- Go, go. Finish it. Finish it.

2141
01:58:32,240 --> 01:58:35,278
Hey! Yes! All right! That's fucking it!

2142
01:58:35,360 --> 01:58:38,160
That's the first shot of the game.
He fucking hit it. That's three now.

2143
01:58:38,280 --> 01:58:41,432
Two plus that fucking rebound.
That's three out of 26.

2144
01:58:41,880 --> 01:58:46,352
Okay, I bet on the Celtics,
specifically Kevin Garnett.

2145
01:58:46,440 --> 01:58:50,798
Two good bets. Celtics are winning
and Garnett's got nine and seven.

2146
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:54,590
So that's 16 right now
on your way to 26, right?

2147
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:56,313
The gorgeous one is here.

2148
01:58:56,480 --> 01:58:57,496
Not even halftime yet?

2149
01:58:57,520 --> 01:59:00,957
Twice in one day. I can't believe it.
From the helicopter to here.

2150
01:59:01,040 --> 01:59:03,396
How you doing, baby?
I can't get you out of my mind.

2151
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:07,161
- You're funny.
- You're hot, baby. You're definitely hot.

2152
01:59:07,200 --> 01:59:09,476
- Yeah.
- So you got money on the Celtics?

2153
01:59:10,680 --> 01:59:13,115
- Is he gonna shoot?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2154
01:59:13,200 --> 01:59:14,736
Come on, Garnett.
That one's gonna help.

2155
01:59:14,760 --> 01:59:17,016
- Come on, man.
- He should've gotten that one.

2156
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:19,191
He missed his shot. Who cares?

2157
01:59:19,280 --> 01:59:21,670
- I have a great idea, after halftime.
- What's that?

2158
01:59:21,800 --> 01:59:24,190
I'd like you to come up to my room.
I hired the chef.

2159
01:59:24,280 --> 01:59:27,591
I'm in Penthouse "A,"
and it's gorgeous. Best views.

2160
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:30,229
- Who could ask for more than that?
- Thank you.

2161
01:59:30,360 --> 01:59:32,556
- I love you, baby. I'll see you there.
- Okay.

2162
01:59:32,680 --> 01:59:34,239
- Penthouse "A."
- Yep. Got it.

2163
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:37,552
- Okay? Thanks. Can't wait to see you.
- Okay, bye.

2164
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:39,754
- Wow.
- The fucking worst.

2165
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:41,160
He's like a cartoon.

2166
01:59:41,240 --> 01:59:42,936
<i>Nine points
to go with seven rebounds.</i>

2167
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:43,960
You okay?

2168
01:59:44,040 --> 01:59:45,400
<i>Boston leads by eight.</i>

2169
01:59:45,880 --> 01:59:47,917
- Oh.
- What happened?

2170
01:59:48,040 --> 01:59:49,576
<i>...offense so far in game seven.</i>

2171
01:59:49,600 --> 01:59:52,672
<i>Let's see if they can in the
second half, which is coming up next.</i>

2172
01:59:55,120 --> 01:59:58,397
- What's going on? You need help?
- Thank you so much for your help.

2173
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:19,070
This is the beauty of betting.
This is the beauty of betting, you know?

2174
02:00:19,160 --> 02:00:21,914
I'm fucking pulling for the Celtics.
A Knicks fan.

2175
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:27,432
If the 12-year-old version of me saw me
right now, he'd be like, "What the fuck?"

2176
02:00:27,560 --> 02:00:30,758
Everybody
is talking about this big bet here,

2177
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:32,354
so it's gotta be her.

2178
02:00:32,760 --> 02:00:34,433
He's with me.

2179
02:00:34,520 --> 02:00:36,876
We're gonna fucking snatch her
and bring her back, boss.

2180
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:39,711
Boss. Absolutely.

2181
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:42,230
I need everyone in here
to lock in.

2182
02:00:42,320 --> 02:00:44,471
KG. Look at KG.

2183
02:00:45,080 --> 02:00:46,080
Remember this.

2184
02:00:46,160 --> 02:00:48,914
If you want to go quickly, do it alone.

2185
02:00:49,320 --> 02:00:53,234
But if you want to go far,
you do it together.

2186
02:00:53,360 --> 02:00:56,114
We're like roaches, and you can't kill us.

2187
02:00:56,200 --> 02:00:58,351
Quit fucking passing. Get it to him.

2188
02:00:58,440 --> 02:01:01,638
And another. And another.
And shoot! Shoot! Shoot!

2189
02:01:02,240 --> 02:01:03,674
Fuck that shit!

2190
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:04,760
Fucking Doc!

2191
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:08,194
Fucking threw his rhythm off.
He took him out of the game.

2192
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:09,950
Fuck, man.

2193
02:01:10,080 --> 02:01:11,480
That's your fault.

2194
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,310
You see that other guy though, Phil?

2195
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:17,632
One of your boys from Boston?
You got some boys in Boston?

2196
02:01:17,720 --> 02:01:19,279
You'll see. Hang on.

2197
02:01:19,840 --> 02:01:22,674
This fucker?
Is that one of your boys, that fat fuck?

2198
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:25,395
Looks like you.
Look like one of your boys.

2199
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:30,035
That's a fucking rebound! That's it!

2200
02:01:30,120 --> 02:01:32,112
Three more. Three more. Way to go.

2201
02:01:32,720 --> 02:01:34,916
What did it say up there?
What is the score?

2202
02:01:35,040 --> 02:01:37,111
- Are they winning?
- They're winning.

2203
02:01:37,200 --> 02:01:38,656
- Another rebound!
- Winning by three points.

2204
02:01:38,680 --> 02:01:41,275
Fuck that shit!
He fucking fouled him!

2205
02:01:41,360 --> 02:01:44,239
Doesn't matter. He grabbed it.
He had it. That counts as one.

2206
02:01:44,320 --> 02:01:45,720
What are we at? Twenty-three?

2207
02:01:48,640 --> 02:01:50,313
All right. Let's go.

2208
02:01:50,400 --> 02:01:52,392
Get it. Pick it up. All right. That's it.

2209
02:01:52,480 --> 02:01:55,473
That's it. Shoot. That's it. Come on, K!

2210
02:01:55,560 --> 02:01:57,233
Shoot it! Shoot it!

2211
02:02:00,760 --> 02:02:02,479
Holy fuck, yeah!

2212
02:02:02,560 --> 02:02:04,119
Thank fucking God!

2213
02:02:05,320 --> 02:02:07,198
<i>Just fucking...
That's all the gem.</i>

2214
02:02:07,720 --> 02:02:08,915
<i>It's all the gem.</i>

2215
02:02:09,800 --> 02:02:11,871
<i>That's... We're at 25 now.</i>

2216
02:02:11,960 --> 02:02:14,555
<i>One more. One more fucking point.</i>

2217
02:02:14,680 --> 02:02:17,240
<i>Either a rebound or a fucking basket.</i>

2218
02:02:17,760 --> 02:02:20,594
<i>Anything. Either one, we fucking got this.</i>

2219
02:02:20,720 --> 02:02:23,920
- Must be housekeeping.
<i>- One more. We just need one more.</i>

2220
02:02:24,440 --> 02:02:26,397
- Oh, my God. Come on in.
- Hi.

2221
02:02:26,480 --> 02:02:29,120
- Three times in one day?
- I know.

2222
02:02:29,200 --> 02:02:30,200
Unbelievable.

2223
02:02:30,320 --> 02:02:33,040
I can't believe it's you.
Where's your boyfriend?

2224
02:02:33,120 --> 02:02:34,554
Why don't we watch the game?

2225
02:02:34,680 --> 02:02:37,136
Without a doubt. Go ahead, honey.
Sit down. Make yourself comfortable.

2226
02:02:37,160 --> 02:02:40,278
- How do I work the remote?
- The iPad's over there.

2227
02:02:40,360 --> 02:02:43,592
Do what you got to do with the iPad.
Look. I gotta take a shower, okay?

2228
02:02:43,680 --> 02:02:46,752
I really gotta take a shower.
I gotta get myself washed.

2229
02:02:46,840 --> 02:02:49,560
That plane ride, it got me all
messed up and everything else.

2230
02:02:49,640 --> 02:02:53,031
So what I want you to do
if that doorbell rings, okay...

2231
02:02:53,160 --> 02:02:56,995
I got my friends coming in,
or I got the food coming, okay?

2232
02:02:57,080 --> 02:03:00,312
- Just answer it and let 'em in.
- Okay. All right.

2233
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:03,880
<i>Garnett.</i>

2234
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:07,394
<i>That's it! That's it!</i>

2235
02:03:07,760 --> 02:03:08,760
Thank you.

2236
02:03:10,680 --> 02:03:13,718
That's it. Okay, that's two. That's done.

2237
02:03:13,800 --> 02:03:16,520
We've got that... Two.
Just gotta win now.

2238
02:03:16,640 --> 02:03:19,712
Celts gotta win and we're fucking done.
We're done, Arno.

2239
02:03:22,720 --> 02:03:24,632
What's the score, baby?

2240
02:03:24,760 --> 02:03:27,416
- Sixty-eight, 73, Boston.
- Sixty-eight, what? In the fourth?

2241
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:29,159
...<i>daring Rondo to shoot.</i>

2242
02:03:29,240 --> 02:03:31,152
Just cancel the fucking food.

2243
02:03:31,240 --> 02:03:32,356
I want to go out.

2244
02:03:32,440 --> 02:03:34,557
Baby, I love that you're into this game.

2245
02:03:35,320 --> 02:03:38,154
<i>Defense!</i>

2246
02:03:40,200 --> 02:03:41,953
<i>Trying to get rid of Brandon Bass.</i>

2247
02:03:42,040 --> 02:03:43,599
<i>Tries it again. Up and under.</i>

2248
02:03:43,680 --> 02:03:45,353
<i>Shot misses. The rebound.</i>

2249
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:47,955
Push it. Push it!

2250

Get it. Get it to him. Yeah!
Don't fucking miss that!

2252
02:03:53,320 --> 02:03:54,976
Don't miss that. That's all right.

2253

It's all right. It's all right.

2254
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:58,757
KG's gonna hit this fucking shot.

Let's ice this shit.

2256

Sink this shot. Sink it. Sink it.

It's all right. It's all right.

2263
02:04:22,160 --> 02:04:25,870
All right. We're up enough.
This is not that big of a deal.

2264
02:04:26,360 --> 02:04:28,795
This will just fucking help seal it,
but we're good.

2265

Don't talk.
Just fucking do your shit, man.

Howard, did we just win?

2283

Oh, my fucking God! Are you kidding me?

2284
02:05:17,600 --> 02:05:18,600
Oh, my God.

He fucking did it.
He fucking did it.

2293

- You always believed.
- You fucking did it.

Yeah, I know. I know. Thank you.

No, you, you, you. I love you.
I love you. I'm so happy.

It's going down. It's going down.

2298

You won. You made your point.
Let's go.

2299
02:05:55,480 --> 02:05:58,359
- You made your mark.
- Hey, listen. Yes.

2300
02:05:58,880 --> 02:06:00,553
Just cash it in, okay?

2301
02:06:00,640 --> 02:06:03,712
And make sure
they fucking walk you to the car.

2302
02:06:03,800 --> 02:06:05,393
I'm gonna book you a Blade.

2303
02:06:05,520 --> 02:06:07,801
- Howard.
- All right. I'll call you back.

2304
02:06:07,840 --> 02:06:09,035
You son of a bitch.

2305
02:06:09,160 --> 02:06:11,240
- Arno.
- I can't fucking believe it.

2306
02:06:14,080 --> 02:06:15,912
What the fuck did you just do?

2307
02:06:16,520 --> 02:06:19,399
- What the fuck!
- Shut up!

2308
02:06:19,520 --> 02:06:21,193
Get me the bags now.

2309
02:06:22,360 --> 02:06:24,670
Get off me! Shut the fuck up,

2310
02:06:24,760 --> 02:06:26,991

You hear me?

2311
02:06:27,080 --> 02:06:29,356
- Don't fucking confuse me.
- Get away from me.

2312
02:06:31,240 --> 02:06:32,816
Take your hands off of me
right now.

2313
02:06:32,840 --> 02:06:34,957
Right now. Go ahead. Go ahead.

I want out of here. Let me out of here.

Let me out.

Stay right fucking there.

- Fuck.

2321

Where you going, asshole?

2322
02:07:11,240 --> 02:07:12,240
Fuck this.

<i>...headed back to the conference finals.</i>

<i>How are you feeling?</i>

2325
02:07:16,560 --> 02:07:19,075
When you win, that's all that matters.
You know?

2326
02:07:19,160 --> 02:07:21,197
The big "be quiet."
The big "shut up." You know?

2327

<i>Killing doubters, killing haters.</i>

2328
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:27,037
- Bring it in. Bring it in.
- Some motherfucking money, right?

2329
02:07:27,120 --> 02:07:28,360
And a personal one to you, bro.

2330

<i>You just celebrated
your 36th birthday.</i>

That's some strong shit. Oh!

2333
02:07:34,640 --> 02:07:37,553
That's my nigga right there, boy.
Look at that motherfucker, man.

2334
02:07:37,640 --> 02:07:39,552
I know that man. I know that man.

2335
02:07:39,640 --> 02:07:42,030
My dad's good with him!

02:07:42,800 --> 02:07:44,314
Hey! I can't think.

2337
02:07:44,400 --> 02:07:48,280
Amy, he was naked and drunk, okay?
I'm calling the police.

2338

<i>Did you feel that he needed
to shoulder his burden...</i>

2343
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:02,515
- It's all there.
- Thank you so much.

2344
02:08:04,760 --> 02:08:06,877
<i>...for us to come out
and carry that burden.</i>

<i>He does a lot for our team.
It's notjust down to one guy.</i>

<i>We all shared that responsibility
and did a good job.</i>

2347
02:08:15,080 --> 02:08:19,074
<i>But in the end, I felt like it was just me
and the rock, nothing else.</i>

2348
02:08:19,160 --> 02:08:21,675
<i>Is this the end
of the Big Three as we know it?</i>

2349
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:25,470
<i>No, I wouldn't say that.
I think we have a lot more in our tank.</i>

<i>We have a lot more to prove.</i>

<i>We want to win.
We're trying to get another ring.</i>

Oh, my God. Wayne, thank you so much.

2353
02:08:32,840 --> 02:08:35,116
My pleasure. A lot of money.

2354
02:08:35,200 --> 02:08:37,635
- Come to the Avalon. Have one drink.
- No, I can't.

2355
02:08:37,720 --> 02:08:39,871
- I don't want to twist your arm.
- I gotta go, baby.

02:08:39,960 --> 02:08:42,156
- Just have one drink.
- We can go now.

all those electronics.
