1
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,153
<i>Behold the great warlord,</i>

2
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:45,222
who tricked his
own loyal vassals

3
00:00:45,246 --> 00:00:46,680
into a noiseless smothering.

4
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:07,400
Mariko-sama!

5
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:21,625
- Nigel!
- Shh!

6
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:24,060
They'll hear us.

7
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,186
I'm being quiet.

8
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:31,268
Look at it.

9
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:33,570
It looks sharp.

10
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,372
Be quiet. They'll hear you.

11
00:01:35,396 --> 00:01:36,673
I'm only going to look.

12
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:37,707
Mother's going to get angry

13
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:39,666
if she knows we're in here.

14
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:43,136
Be careful.

15
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:46,550
Why is it chipped?

16
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:49,519
Because Grandfather used it
to fight off a whole army

17
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:51,321
of Japanese assassins.

18
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:11,031
Was it really given
to you by a savage?

19
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,765
Mariko-sama.

20
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,138
Mariko-sama!

21
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:14,204
Heavenly Father,
we commit to you,

22
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:16,439
your loyal servant...

23
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:18,398
Mariko-sama.

24
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:20,610
Mariko-sama.

25
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,435
Mariko-sama.

26
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:54,014
Yabushige-dono! Yabushige-dono!

27
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:39,696
<i>Was it really given to you</i>

28
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,721
<i>by a savage?</i>

29
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,234
<i>We live,</i>

30
00:13:44,258 --> 00:13:46,236
and we die.

31
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:01,434
Well, get it over with, then.

32
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:06,716
You have been
permitted to return

33
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,718
to Toranaga-sama's galley.

34
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,320
Here is your pass.

35
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:12,022
Why am I receiving

36
00:15:12,046 --> 00:15:13,623
this permission
from Lord Kiyama?

37
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:15,625
Where is Yabushige-sama?

38
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:17,627
He is preparing the
galley in Osaka Bay.

39
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:19,586
I have come to bring you to him.

40
00:15:26,627 --> 00:15:29,339
All families have now
been released from Osaka.

41
00:15:29,363 --> 00:15:32,442
Praise be to God, at least
that crisis is behind us.

42
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:35,712
Toranaga won't be surrendering.

43
00:15:35,736 --> 00:15:37,480
Not yet.

44
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:41,084
Ishido-sama has mobilized the
Council of Regents to war.

45
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:43,486
The Lady Ochiba has
pledged her son's support.

46
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,722
Toranaga will be dead in weeks.

47
00:15:45,746 --> 00:15:48,058
Then you don't know.

48
00:15:48,082 --> 00:15:50,350
Yoshii Toranaga.

49
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:04,107
The hostages are free.

50
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:06,633
He got just what he wanted.

51
00:16:08,235 --> 00:16:11,738
No dirty hands, no war.

52
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:17,043
Just a woman.

53
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:25,452
She couldn't have
heard me... before.

54
00:16:26,787 --> 00:16:31,701
Before she died, I
spoke before God.

55
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:35,729
Not your God or my God

56
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,333
just God.

57
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:47,183
Do you think it was acceptable?

58
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:50,577
Rest assured she was
already sanctified.

59
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:55,448
Before her death, she came to
me and received absolution.

60
00:17:00,554 --> 00:17:01,765
I think it would
have pleased her

61
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:03,333
to see us being civil.

62
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,205
Yes.

63
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:11,464
Yes, you may be right.

64
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,711
Perhaps there
might come a time

65
00:17:14,735 --> 00:17:17,047
we can set aside
our differences.

66
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:21,218
Yes.

67
00:17:21,242 --> 00:17:23,687
All this nonsense.

68
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:27,190
Catholic and Protestant
and Calvinist

69
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:30,627
and every other shitist.

70
00:17:30,651 --> 00:17:34,487
It's only a shame that
day will never come.

71
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:39,092
Will it, Father?

72
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:46,309
Is this where I'm
to be ambushed,

73
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,612
like the last time
I tried to leave?

74
00:17:48,636 --> 00:17:51,214
No longer protected.

75
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:54,317
Is that how I
finally meet my end?

76
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:57,287
I will not deny it,

77
00:17:57,311 --> 00:17:59,446
you were meant to
die in these woods.

78
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:03,483
But an arrangement was made.

79
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:07,163
You will leave Osaka alive.

80
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:12,102
You'll have to forgive me
if I'm having some trouble

81
00:18:12,126 --> 00:18:15,639
accepting anything on your word.

82
00:18:15,663 --> 00:18:20,166
On this, you will
just have to trust me.

83
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:50,063
Go with God, Anjin-sama.

84
00:18:58,205 --> 00:18:59,573
It was Lady Maria.

85
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,024
She asked the Church
to spare your life

86
00:19:08,048 --> 00:19:09,082
before she died.

87
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:15,165
And now I have...

88
00:19:15,189 --> 00:19:17,057
I have kept my word to her.

89
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:22,195
Goodbye.

90
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:25,065
And good luck.

91
00:22:04,124 --> 00:22:05,325
England.

92
00:22:18,639 --> 00:22:20,674
Pull yourself together, man.

93
00:24:15,656 --> 00:24:20,627
Enemies? Christians did this?

94
00:24:26,366 --> 00:24:28,335
Mariko-sama.

95
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:00,480
Hmm.

96
00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:34,361
What is that?

97
00:31:55,382 --> 00:31:57,017
Anjin-sama...

98
00:32:22,809 --> 00:32:24,344
Yes.

99
00:33:04,751 --> 00:33:07,220
Well, you served him well.

100
00:36:57,651 --> 00:37:01,454
Forgive me for the
deception, Anjin-dono.

101
00:37:02,556 --> 00:37:05,502
I was born Tonomoto Akinao,

102
00:37:05,526 --> 00:37:08,672
in the Azuchi Prefecture.

103
00:37:08,696 --> 00:37:11,074
I am samurai.

104
00:37:11,098 --> 00:37:14,377
In order to spy on his enemies,

105
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:18,682
years ago, my lord ordered
me to convert to the religion

106
00:37:18,706 --> 00:37:22,352
of the Portuguese, so
I took the name Muraji

107
00:37:22,376 --> 00:37:23,653
and moved here.

108
00:37:23,677 --> 00:37:26,780
Well, at least
you're not Catholic.

109
00:37:30,284 --> 00:37:33,029
I am a Christian, and also,

110
00:37:33,053 --> 00:37:37,801
I am Tonomoto Akinao,
vassal to Toranaga-sama.

111
00:37:37,825 --> 00:37:41,171
I am both these things.

112
00:37:41,195 --> 00:37:44,741
My lord says he will not rest

113
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:49,579
until he finds those who
helped destroy your ship.

114
00:37:49,603 --> 00:37:52,382
Muraji...

115
00:37:52,406 --> 00:37:54,017
I've prepared something
to say in Japanese.

116
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:56,109
Perhaps you will
help me if I falter.

117
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:31,187
Hope. Or is the word you
are looking for "faith"?

118
00:38:31,211 --> 00:38:34,180
At this point,
either one will do.

119
00:39:04,845 --> 00:39:08,325
He asks why you do not
wish to fight your enemies.

120
00:39:08,349 --> 00:39:10,717
My enemies didn't burn my ship.

121
00:39:14,855 --> 00:39:17,567
It was Mariko-sama.

122
00:39:17,591 --> 00:39:21,294
She hated my war
against the Catholics.

123
00:39:25,098 --> 00:39:28,645
So she made an
arrangement in Osaka

124
00:39:28,669 --> 00:39:31,514
to trade my survival

125
00:39:31,538 --> 00:39:34,040
for the destruction of my ship.

126
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,415
So, you see?

127
00:39:57,431 --> 00:39:59,633
I don't need it anymore.

128
00:40:25,792 --> 00:40:29,272
He says the sentence
stays until the disloyal

129
00:40:29,296 --> 00:40:31,197
have been found.

130
00:40:44,745 --> 00:40:47,113
I was the disloyal one.

131
00:41:24,751 --> 00:41:27,554
Don't you understand?

132
00:41:30,824 --> 00:41:33,126
I came here to use you.

133
00:41:37,864 --> 00:41:39,699
To use you!

134
00:41:42,469 --> 00:41:46,116
From the day I set
foot on your shores,

135
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,585
I fed you shit.

136
00:41:48,609 --> 00:41:53,380
I fed you... shit.

137
00:42:45,666 --> 00:42:47,367
Fuck it.

138
00:42:48,735 --> 00:42:52,038
We live and we die.

139
00:46:51,411 --> 00:46:53,780
Ah.

140
00:54:20,727 --> 00:54:23,740
Fuji-sama, you've
served me all this time.

141
00:54:23,764 --> 00:54:28,144
Please just allow me
this one final gesture.

142
00:54:28,168 --> 00:54:29,269
Look.

143
00:54:45,252 --> 00:54:48,064
I've always been of
the mind that a soul

144
00:54:48,088 --> 00:54:51,201
committed to the
deep is a soul who,

145
00:54:51,225 --> 00:54:52,802
in some way,

146
00:54:52,826 --> 00:54:57,330
lives on forever within it.

147
00:55:05,706 --> 00:55:07,507
<i>Hai.</i>

148
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:11,531
<i>Raise the ropes!</i>

149
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:14,277
I know you're tired, but

150
00:57:14,301 --> 00:57:16,179
tide's come up some,
so we'll try again.

151
00:57:16,203 --> 00:57:18,038
There you go.

152
00:57:33,287 --> 00:57:34,464
We're pissing in the wind.

153
00:57:34,488 --> 00:57:36,066
We need more water.

154
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:37,591
Tell them they can rest.

155
00:58:08,055 --> 00:58:09,065
Right.

156
00:58:09,089 --> 00:58:10,200
Yes.

157
00:58:10,224 --> 00:58:12,068
Yes, this is wonderful.

158
00:58:12,092 --> 00:58:14,037
Raise the ropes!

159
00:58:14,061 --> 00:58:16,206
Right, you miserable, sniveling

160
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:17,741
festering shit rags!

161
00:58:17,765 --> 00:58:19,743
- I have a feeling this is the one!
- Ah.

162
00:58:19,767 --> 00:58:21,578
No! No, no, Muraji.

163
00:58:21,602 --> 00:58:23,146
Just, uh, keep that
between you and I.

164
00:58:50,764 --> 00:58:53,076
There she is!

165
00:58:54,468 --> 00:58:56,246
I told you she was beautiful!

166
00:58:56,270 --> 00:58:58,281
I told you she'd be
worth the blisters!

167
00:59:13,787 --> 00:59:15,432
That's enough! That's enough.

168
01:00:14,348 --> 01:00:15,715
Hmm.

169
