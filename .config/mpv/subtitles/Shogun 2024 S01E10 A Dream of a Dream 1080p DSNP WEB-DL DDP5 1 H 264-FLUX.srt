1
00:00:06,583 --> 00:00:08,166
<i>Previously on</i> Shogun.

2
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:13,416
Now are you ready
to do your part?

3
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:15,583
I'm ready.

4
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:18,142
I am leaving tomorrow.

5
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:19,166
You forget your manners!

6
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:22,642
Unless we are confined here.

7
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:24,791
No one is confined here.

8
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:28,791
It's true we are all being
kept here against our will.

9
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:31,833
I cannot live with the offense.

10
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:36,291
Your permits.

11
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:40,434
Behold, the great warlord who
tricked his own loyal vassals

12
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:41,934
into a noiseless smothering.

13
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,059
A message from Lord Ishido.

14
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:47,226
Your offer of service
instead of death

15
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,708
he accepts.

16
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:50,684
They've infiltrated the castle.

17
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:51,851
We should go to the gate!

18
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:53,375
I will not risk being captured.

19
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:55,142
It's Ishido

20
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:57,041
he'll never let us leave alive.

21
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:02,625
Mariko-<i>sama</i>!

22
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:16,934
Nigel!

23
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:18,708
He's gonna hear us.

24
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:20,708
I'm being quiet.

25
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:23,791
Who's gonna know?

26
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:27,625
Look at it. It looks sharp.

27
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:30,267
Be quiet. He'll hear you.

28
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:31,726
I'm only going to look.

29
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,500
Mother's going to get angry
if she knows we're in here.

30
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:37,833
Be careful.

31
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,083
Why is it chipped?

32
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:46,583
Because Grandfather used it to fight
off a whole army of Japanese assassins.

33
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:06,125
Was it really given
to you by a savage?

34
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,625
Anjin!

35
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:27,208
Get up!

36
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,601
Anjin!

37
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:30,625
Get up!

38
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:40,916
Mariko-<i>sama</i>.

39
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,208
Mariko-<i>sama</i>!

40
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,809
Heavenly Father,

41
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:13,333
we commit to you your
loyal servant, Mariko-<i>sama</i>.

42
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,833
Mariko-<i>sama,</i> Mariko-<i>sama</i>.

43
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,041
Lady Mariko!

44
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,625
Forgive me...

45
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:27,041
All of this was
tragic and avoidable.

46
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:31,726
Osaka Castle isn't as safe
as we were led to believe

47
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,750
that much is clear.

48
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:37,892
Lady Mariko should have been

49
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:40,333
allowed to leave
without incident.

50
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,625
What does it matter now.

51
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,625
A letter of protest
from my brother.

52
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,226
The violent death
of his prized vassal

53
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,250
has left him shocked.

54
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:06,958
He has fled Edo in secret
and prepares for war.

55
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:11,750
This means nothing.

56
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:18,041
Whether he surrenders here
or in battle is up to him.

57
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:24,833
What matters is we are united.

58
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:34,666
To think this
dishonorable attack

59
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:37,958
could have been ordered by
a member of this Council...

60
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:43,809
Such a despicable attack.

61
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:47,333
Only Toranaga is conniving
enough to pull it off.

62
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:51,416
He's trying to sow
division between us.

63
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:56,208
It is our duty to
end his threat.

64
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:58,666
I say

65
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,333
we march.

66
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:07,458
Lady Mariko must first be
given a Christian burial.

67
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:11,017
I am sorry for Mariko's death,

68
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:14,375
but let us not forget
she was Akechi.

69
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:18,083
The same line that murdered
Lady Ochiba's father.

70
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,416
Lady Mariko will

71
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,291
generously

72
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,875
be honored.

73
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,458
Fine.

74
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,958
In that case, we'll
go to war after.

75
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:46,142
And with the Heir's support.

76
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,208
Of course.

77
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:51,250
His banners make
our side lawful,

78
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,916
and Toranaga's unlawful.

79
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:58,750
And what will be done
about the heretic?

80
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,684
After we vote for war,

81
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:06,041
what happens to him is no
longer of interest to me.

82
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:15,375
War is inevitable.

83
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,583
Inevitable.

84
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,875
This matter...

85
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,958
Perhaps it requires
a bit more debate.

86
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,767
Stop this superstition.

87
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:46,916
We're not peasants, digging
in the dirt for meaning.

88
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,708
We are protectors of the Realm.

89
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,291
The vote is done.

90
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:12,708
You look well.

91
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:21,291
Your hearing... is it improving?

92
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,166
Ears.

93
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,833
Thank you.

94
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:37,125
I thought Lady Mariko
would only be captured.

95
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:42,125
She resisted, and she died.

96
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,541
There was nothing we could do.

97
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:51,083
Your efforts will
not be forgotten.

98
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,642
After Toranaga is gone,

99
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:56,500
your seat on the
Council is secured.

100
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,375
The strangest thing...

101
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:11,583
When the Taikō was about
to go to war with Toranaga,

102
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,309
he had all the votes

103
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,559
until that earthquake hit.

104
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:20,541
It was a big one
beneath Lake Biwa.

105
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,458
His allies called it a bad omen.

106
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,666
The Taikō was forced
to forge a peace.

107
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,250
That was long ago.

108
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:35,958
Where is it?

109
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,500
He blamed the catfish.

110
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,101
Its thick, ugly tail
shaking the earth.

111
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,541
Yabushige. Yabushige!

112
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:51,166
There are no catfish
in that pond.

113
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,375
Ah...

114
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:58,791
Of course I know that.

115
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,166
Return to Izu.

116
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,083
Gather your army.
Wait for my command.

117
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,291
Huh?

118
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,416
I return you to the sky.

119
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,250
Bear many daughters.

120
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,583
<i>Was it really given
to you by a savage?</i>

121
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:37,416
We live and we die.

122
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:55,458
You've been asleep
a long time...

123
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:11,166
Lady Mariko was
buried the other day.

124
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,375
Get up. Time to leave.

125
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:26,958
Lord Kiyama's men will
escort you to the harbor.

126
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,083
Well, get it over with then.

127
00:14:56,833 --> 00:15:00,166
You have been permitted to
return to Toranaga-<i>sama's</i> galley.

128
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,000
Here is your pass.

129
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,726
Why am I receiving this
permission from Lord Kiyama?

130
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,184
Where is Yabushige-<i>sama</i>?

131
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:11,250
He's preparing the galley in Osaka
Bay. I have come to bring you to him.

132
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,934
All families have now
been released from Osaka.

133
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:24,125
Praise be to God. At least
that crisis is behind us.

134
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,750
Toranaga won't be surrendering.

135
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:28,934
Not yet.

136
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:32,041
Ishido-<i>sama</i> has mobilized the
Council of Regents to war.

137
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,226
The Lady Ochiba has
pledged her son's support.

138
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,684
Toranaga will be dead in weeks.

139
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:41,833
Then you don't know
Yoshii Toranaga.

140
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,750
The hostages are free.

141
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,333
Got just what he wanted.

142
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:03,500
No dirty hands, no war.

143
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,625
Just a woman.

144
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:17,000
She can't have heard me before

145
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,208
before she died.

146
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,434
I spoke before God.

147
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:26,958
Not your God or my God.

148
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:31,416
Just God.

149
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,833
Do you think it was acceptable?

150
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,125
Rest assured she was
already sanctified.

151
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:47,125
Before her death, she came to
me and received absolution.

152
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,000
I think it would've pleased
her to see us being civil.

153
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:02,291
Yes. Yes, you may be right.

154
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:08,166
Perhaps there might come a time
we can set aside our differences.

155
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,041
Yes.

156
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,000
All this nonsense.

157
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:21,541
Catholic and Protestant, and
Calvinist and every other shitist.

158
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,083
It's only a shame that
day will never come.

159
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,375
Will it, Father?

160
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,934
Is this where I'm
to be ambushed?

161
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:40,291
Like the last time
I tried to leave.

162
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,916
No longer protected.

163
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,458
Is that how I
finally meet my end?

164
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,708
I will not deny it.

165
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:51,125
You were meant to
die in these woods.

166
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,750
But an arrangement was made.

167
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,250
You will leave Osaka alive.

168
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:03,666
You'll have to forgive me
if I'm having some trouble

169
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,083
accepting anything on your word.

170
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:11,291
On this, you will
just have to trust me.

171
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:41,000
Go with God, Anjin-<i>sama</i>.

172
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,250
It was Lady Maria.

173
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,666
She asked the Church to spare
your life before she died.

174
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,416
And now I have.

175
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,958
I have kept my word to her.

176
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,291
Goodbye.

177
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:16,625
And good luck.

178
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:20,000
What does it mean, "on
a leafless branch"?

179
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:23,916
It was written by my friend.

180
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,916
The one who was just buried?

181
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,333
Yes.

182
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:37,083
So we must finish the poem.

183
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:43,083
What line would you write next?

184
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,208
Well

185
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,750
a branch can have fruit

186
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,125
also flowers...

187
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,750
How about...

188
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:04,416
<i>Flowers are only flowers
because they fall.</i>

189
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:09,500
<i>But thankfully, the wind.</i>

190
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:38,458
We should never
have gone to Osaka.

191
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,684
Your ship.

192
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,750
We could sail on it together.

193
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,083
To your home country.

194
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,708
What's your country called?

195
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:52,541
- Country.
- Country, yes. What is it?

196
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:55,059
England.

197
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:56,208
Take me there.

198
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,041
Don't you understand?

199
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:01,166
Here, then...

200
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:02,934
Teach me how to dive.

201
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,851
Like you taught Toranaga.

202
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,916
Show me.

203
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,267
Huh? Pull yourself
together, man.

204
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:12,166
What are you saying? Hurry!

205
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:15,833
Look!

206
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:55,666
Omi!

207
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:07,291
I'm sorry...

208
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,541
Lord Yabushige...

209
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:12,875
I'm instructed to
ask for your swords.

210
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:17,208
My swords.

211
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:27,708
These men belong to Lord
Toranaga, our liege lord.

212
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:35,000
The orders also belong to him.

213
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,625
Of course.

214
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:42,375
This way.

215
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:54,500
Enemies slipped past our
guards by cover of night.

216
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:57,583
They knew exactly
where to strike.

217
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:00,708
Christians, we think.

218
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:03,791
It's all so terrible...

219
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,416
Enemies? Christians did this?

220
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:16,875
Mariko-<i>sama</i>.

221
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,583
Come this way!

222
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,666
Please stop.

223
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:28,101
Until we find those who
aided the Christian raiders,

224
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:32,059
no one in this
village will rest.

225
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:35,208
Lord Toranaga has ordered it.

226
00:24:58,333 --> 00:24:59,143
Lord.

227
00:24:59,167 --> 00:25:03,250
Thank you for returning my
consorts and my vassals.

228
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:07,458
You've heard the news
that Lady Mariko is dead.

229
00:25:07,958 --> 00:25:09,500
Yes, I know.

230
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,226
That night,

231
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:16,625
you were seen letting
intruders into my quarters.

232
00:25:19,875 --> 00:25:25,875
One of Mariko's ladies-in-waiting
was with you in the cellar.

233
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,625
She sent a letter to Omi.

234
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:33,392
After Lady Mariko's death,

235
00:25:33,416 --> 00:25:36,125
they say you were guilt-stricken
and asked for forgiveness.

236
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:43,333
I felt it was my duty
to alert our lord.

237
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:47,125
Did you aid this attack?

238
00:25:52,666 --> 00:25:54,041
Yes I did.

239
00:25:54,708 --> 00:25:55,833
Fine.

240
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:59,267
All of your lands are forfeit.

241
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:02,250
Please slit your belly
by sunset tomorrow.

242
00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:04,083
Lord...

243
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:07,666
If you must kill me,
give me a good death!

244
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:10,500
Like being torn apart by cannon

245
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,708
or eaten alive by a
school of angry fish.

246
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:16,958
I beg you! Please!

247
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:21,916
Fine suggestions, but
I don't trust you.

248
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:25,875
Please commit seppuku
by sunset tomorrow.

249
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:31,851
Izu is the fief of
the Kashigi clan.

250
00:26:31,875 --> 00:26:34,726
I declare Omi to be my heir,

251
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:37,351
and request it be given to him.

252
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:42,250
It is fair to ask, but Izu
is no longer yours to give.

253
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,958
Who would you like
to second your death?

254
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:51,333
Let it be the Anjin.

255
00:26:54,541 --> 00:26:55,541
No.

256
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,934
In that case,

257
00:26:59,958 --> 00:27:03,583
I would be honored if
it would be you, Lord.

258
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:06,083
I shall.

259
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,708
Until tomorrow, then.

260
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:16,333
May Fudō Myō'ō
smile on tomorrow.

261
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,333
Hmm.

262
00:27:50,208 --> 00:27:51,208
Fuji...

263
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:58,976
You look

264
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,500
healthy and strong.

265
00:28:05,958 --> 00:28:07,458
Thank you.

266
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:29,625
No translator.

267
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:51,583
You protected my new son.

268
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:54,250
I am grateful to all of you.

269
00:28:56,041 --> 00:29:00,625
So many have been lost
since we parted in Osaka.

270
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:05,851
Beginning with Lord Nagakado,

271
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:09,291
whom we still mourn.

272
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:15,184
Thankfully I have more sons,

273
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:17,208
because of you.

274
00:29:31,541 --> 00:29:36,976
The morning we
left Osaka Castle,

275
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,958
this came in secret
from Lady Ochiba.

276
00:29:43,708 --> 00:29:44,750
Have you read it?

277
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:48,625
What a suggestion!

278
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:34,375
<i>If I could use words</i>

279
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:38,000
<i>like scattering flowers
and falling leaves,</i>

280
00:30:38,958 --> 00:30:40,625
<i>what a bonfire my
poems would make.</i>

281
00:30:43,166 --> 00:30:47,791
Those words are too
beautiful to belong to you.

282
00:30:49,708 --> 00:30:51,458
They belong to Lady Mariko.

283
00:30:54,541 --> 00:30:59,000
Only her words
remain with us now.

284
00:31:05,916 --> 00:31:11,916
But what a bonfire she made.

285
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:23,916
What is that?

286
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:29,726
They carry remains of my
husband, Lord Tadayoshi,

287
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:33,333
and my only son Tsurumaru.

288
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,666
I should bury them
in the family temple,

289
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,958
but I wish to be close to them.

290
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,500
I'm not sure what to do...

291
00:31:44,791 --> 00:31:45,875
Anjin-sama.

292
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,208
Tomorrow I am leaving.

293
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:56,958
Lord Toranaga has given me
permission to become a nun.

294
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:02,958
Do you understand what I say?

295
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:06,583
"Nun"?

296
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:10,666
Fuji, nun?

297
00:32:12,583 --> 00:32:13,684
Yes.

298
00:32:13,708 --> 00:32:14,708
Nun.

299
00:32:17,583 --> 00:32:19,708
I wish

300
00:32:19,958 --> 00:32:23,500
for you to stay.

301
00:32:26,416 --> 00:32:27,666
Impossible.

302
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,416
I order it.

303
00:32:32,416 --> 00:32:33,791
Fuji is

304
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:36,000
consort.

305
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:39,976
So sorry,

306
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,416
but I am no longer your consort.

307
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:51,541
My service to Lord
Toranaga is now complete.

308
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:56,166
Well, you served him well.

309
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:00,166
Fuji

310
00:33:01,791 --> 00:33:04,083
best nun.

311
00:33:07,541 --> 00:33:09,166
I will try.

312
00:33:11,708 --> 00:33:13,791
However...

313
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:18,708
I am sad for this village.

314
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:20,583
Ajiro.

315
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,601
After what happened
to your ship,

316
00:33:24,625 --> 00:33:26,708
the villagers are being
severely punished.

317
00:33:27,833 --> 00:33:29,333
I am sad too.

318
00:33:35,916 --> 00:33:36,916
Fuji.

319
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:43,166
Prepare message
for Lord Toranaga.

320
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:46,625
Wish to see him tomorrow.

321
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:23,708
Your sword and your gun.

322
00:35:36,791 --> 00:35:38,708
I will bring you
to Lord Toranaga.

323
00:36:10,916 --> 00:36:13,125
Tell him

324
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,125
we are disgusted by the
destruction of his ship.

325
00:36:19,958 --> 00:36:25,208
My men will not rest until
the saboteur is found.

326
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:35,208
Lord, perhaps this is too much for
a simple fisherman to translate.

327
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:37,291
Does he still not know?

328
00:36:41,041 --> 00:36:42,041
Tell him.

329
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:48,166
Forgive me for the
deception, Anjin-<i>dono</i>.

330
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:54,958
I was born Tonomoto Akinao,
in the Azuchi prefecture.

331
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:56,750
I am samurai.

332
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:01,517
In order to spy on his enemies,

333
00:37:01,541 --> 00:37:06,976
years ago, my lord ordered me to convert
to the religion of the Portuguese.

334
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,500
So I took the name
Muraji and moved here.

335
00:37:11,416 --> 00:37:13,583
Well at least
you're not Catholic.

336
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:22,642
I am a Christian and also
I am Tonomoto Akinao,

337
00:37:22,666 --> 00:37:24,642
vassal to Toranaga-<i>sama</i>.

338
00:37:24,666 --> 00:37:27,333
I am both these things.

339
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:31,351
My lord says he will not rest

340
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:35,500
until he finds those who
helped destroy your ship.

341
00:37:37,166 --> 00:37:38,166
Muraji,

342
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,267
I've prepared something
to say in Japanese.

343
00:37:41,291 --> 00:37:43,125
Perhaps you will
help me if I falter.

344
00:37:44,916 --> 00:37:48,750
Thank you for
agreeing to see me.

345
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:53,226
The day you surrendered
to your brother...

346
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:56,958
I apologize for my disrespect.

347
00:37:58,416 --> 00:38:00,666
Back then, I had

348
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:06,833
given up

349
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:09,416
that...

350
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:12,708
"Hope"?

351
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,059
Hope.

352
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:17,916
Or is the word you are
looking for "faith"?

353
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:20,916
At this point, either
one of them will do.

354
00:38:26,458 --> 00:38:29,083
Please leave Ajiro alone.

355
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:33,208
One man lost hope,

356
00:38:35,666 --> 00:38:38,791
but Ajiro is loyal.

357
00:38:39,958 --> 00:38:45,875
Why does he care about
the plight of my village?

358
00:38:47,541 --> 00:38:50,976
Doesn't he seek
vengeance on his enemies?

359
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,684
He asks why you do not
wish to fight your enemies.

360
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,666
My enemies didn't burn my ship.

361
00:38:57,958 --> 00:39:01,642
He says it was not his
enemies who burned the ship.

362
00:39:01,666 --> 00:39:06,767
It was Mariko-<i>sama</i>. She hated
my war against the Catholics.

363
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:08,809
He says it was Lady Mariko...

364
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:11,684
She hated his war with
the Christians in Japan.

365
00:39:11,708 --> 00:39:14,708
So she made an
arrangement in Osaka

366
00:39:16,208 --> 00:39:20,666
to trade my survival for
the destruction of my ship.

367
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,833
She ordered the destruction of
his ship in exchange for his life.

368
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:28,750
So you see?

369
00:39:31,125 --> 00:39:32,625
This death, not right.

370
00:39:33,416 --> 00:39:37,041
Want no more blood.

371
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,750
What about the Anjin's war?

372
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:46,041
I don't need it anymore.

373
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,583
My war

374
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:56,291
small war.

375
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:01,250
I refuse his request.

376
00:40:02,916 --> 00:40:03,958
Why?

377
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:10,517
Those who are disloyal to me continue
to breathe air in my domain...

378
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:12,416
I cannot just stand by.

379
00:40:12,666 --> 00:40:17,666
He says the sentence stays until
the disloyal have been found.

380
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:30,916
What are you doing?

381
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:33,416
I was the disloyal one.

382
00:40:37,666 --> 00:40:38,666
I die,

383
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:40,583
not village.

384
00:40:41,416 --> 00:40:43,000
Who do you think you are?

385
00:40:44,416 --> 00:40:48,476
Does he really think that
if he takes his own life

386
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,625
I would stop searching
for these traitors?

387
00:40:54,125 --> 00:40:56,583
I die,

388
00:40:58,125 --> 00:41:01,000
not village.

389
00:41:05,708 --> 00:41:06,708
No.

390
00:41:11,666 --> 00:41:13,208
Don't you understand?

391
00:41:17,791 --> 00:41:19,416
I came here to use you.

392
00:41:24,833 --> 00:41:26,458
To use you!

393
00:41:29,083 --> 00:41:31,833
From the day I set
foot on your shores,

394
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:35,517
I fed you shit.

395
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:40,083
I fed you shit.

396
00:41:48,666 --> 00:41:50,666
"Enemy."

397
00:41:56,375 --> 00:41:58,041
Enemy!

398
00:42:32,666 --> 00:42:33,666
Fuck it.

399
00:42:36,416 --> 00:42:37,708
We live and we die.

400
00:42:46,583 --> 00:42:52,583
I, Anjin, by my death

401
00:42:53,041 --> 00:42:59,041
protest the callous punishment of
this village by Yoshii Toranaga.

402
00:43:12,708 --> 00:43:13,708
Enough!

403
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:25,976
If you're finally done,

404
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,934
rebuild that ship,

405
00:43:27,958 --> 00:43:30,833
and make me a fleet.

406
00:43:56,458 --> 00:43:59,041
Find a good husband for my wife.

407
00:43:59,666 --> 00:44:01,958
Make sure he's not an idiot.

408
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:08,392
You made me your heir...

409
00:44:08,416 --> 00:44:12,101
I'm grateful.

410
00:44:12,125 --> 00:44:13,416
Uncle...

411
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:24,708
I swear the name of Kashigi
is safe in my hands.

412
00:44:25,208 --> 00:44:27,500
If I didn't think so, I
wouldn't have suggested it.

413
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:33,166
I considered you
the son I never had.

414
00:44:36,875 --> 00:44:38,500
My death poem.

415
00:45:02,958 --> 00:45:06,059
<i>My dead body,</i>

416
00:45:06,083 --> 00:45:10,392
<i>Don't burn it, Don't bury it,
Just leave it in the field.</i>

417
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,958
<i>And with it, fill the
belly of some hungry dog.</i>

418
00:45:14,291 --> 00:45:15,958
Impressive, right?

419
00:45:16,958 --> 00:45:19,541
I think my skills have
never been sharper.

420
00:45:20,791 --> 00:45:24,750
I have learned much from you.

421
00:45:27,541 --> 00:45:29,625
And now the learning ends.

422
00:45:36,791 --> 00:45:37,958
My final will.

423
00:45:43,958 --> 00:45:45,583
Have a good death.

424
00:46:05,708 --> 00:46:08,833
I'm sorry to say it goes
no further than this.

425
00:46:10,791 --> 00:46:13,166
My nephew will make
a good vassal to you.

426
00:46:14,541 --> 00:46:16,583
You'll be lucky to have him.

427
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:19,916
I have you to thank for that.

428
00:46:21,625 --> 00:46:23,166
And the Anjin.

429
00:46:23,458 --> 00:46:25,625
You have me to
thank for him too.

430
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:45,958
If only I could have
lived to see it...

431
00:46:48,458 --> 00:46:52,458
The day your plan comes
together, whatever it is...

432
00:46:54,083 --> 00:46:55,541
My nephew's first battle...

433
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,351
When the Anjin sails against

434
00:46:58,375 --> 00:47:00,083
the Christians who
burned his ship...

435
00:47:00,541 --> 00:47:02,916
So many days I could have seen.

436
00:47:03,916 --> 00:47:06,083
If only it were that simple.

437
00:47:09,083 --> 00:47:11,041
The ship had to be destroyed.

438
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:18,041
It was between that
and the Anjin's life.

439
00:47:18,875 --> 00:47:23,392
Appointing a watchman
to spread gunpowder

440
00:47:23,416 --> 00:47:25,750
wasn't that hard.

441
00:47:26,416 --> 00:47:31,625
Mariko negotiated for
the Church, and I agreed.

442
00:47:32,708 --> 00:47:35,333
You burned that ship.

443
00:47:38,625 --> 00:47:42,833
It was a necessary
ruse to test the Anjin.

444
00:47:44,541 --> 00:47:48,125
Perhaps someday I'll
tell him the truth.

445
00:47:48,833 --> 00:47:54,833
By then he'll have
rebuilt the ship,

446
00:47:54,958 --> 00:47:58,791
and I'll likely have
to destroy it again.

447
00:48:00,666 --> 00:48:06,666
I don't think it's his
fate to ever leave Japan.

448
00:48:09,291 --> 00:48:12,833
How does it feel

449
00:48:14,041 --> 00:48:18,291
to shape the wind to your will?

450
00:48:20,458 --> 00:48:23,041
I don't control the wind.

451
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,500
I only study it.

452
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,434
But how can you win this?

453
00:48:32,458 --> 00:48:34,750
With your forces outnumbered,

454
00:48:34,958 --> 00:48:37,333
the Heir's army
about to attack...

455
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:41,541
Is it Crimson Sky?

456
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:45,351
I suppose it could work,

457
00:48:45,375 --> 00:48:49,708
but I don't see how.

458
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:53,125
At least tell me before I die...

459
00:48:53,625 --> 00:48:54,958
Yabushige.

460
00:48:56,916 --> 00:49:00,083
After all we've been through,

461
00:49:00,708 --> 00:49:05,708
I thought you of all
people would see.

462
00:49:06,625 --> 00:49:09,726
Crimson Sky is already finished.

463
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:11,892
With the Regents united,

464
00:49:11,916 --> 00:49:14,767
I could never send
an army to Osaka.

465
00:49:14,791 --> 00:49:17,125
It would have meant
certain death.

466
00:49:18,833 --> 00:49:23,934
So I sent a woman to do

467
00:49:23,958 --> 00:49:26,208
what an army never could.

468
00:49:36,916 --> 00:49:40,583
Don't you see
what's coming next?

469
00:49:46,291 --> 00:49:48,750
In just one month,

470
00:49:48,958 --> 00:49:52,541
we will meet our
enemies at Sekigahara.

471
00:49:54,375 --> 00:49:59,291
Five armies squaring off
on the field of battle.

472
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,434
And you're right...

473
00:50:04,458 --> 00:50:09,333
With the Heir's army on
Ishido's side, I'd be finished.

474
00:50:17,333 --> 00:50:18,642
However,

475
00:50:18,666 --> 00:50:20,916
because of Mariko's actions,

476
00:50:21,666 --> 00:50:25,625
Lady Ochiba has grown tired
of her alliance with Ishido.

477
00:50:25,958 --> 00:50:28,708
In a letter to me,
she secretly pledged

478
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:32,708
to keep the Heir's army
from the battlefield.

479
00:50:34,708 --> 00:50:38,583
On that day, Ishido
will have no banner.

480
00:50:39,458 --> 00:50:44,208
The Regents will turn on
him before a sword is drawn.

481
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,416
Only then will my
dream be realized...

482
00:50:51,208 --> 00:50:57,208
I will start it in Edo,
my center of power.

483
00:50:58,375 --> 00:51:02,184
A nation without wars.

484
00:51:02,208 --> 00:51:04,958
An era of great peace.

485
00:51:07,833 --> 00:51:10,500
All of us have
made this possible.

486
00:51:11,875 --> 00:51:14,000
You, me,

487
00:51:15,541 --> 00:51:17,375
Lady Mariko...

488
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:23,291
Even the barbarian who
came out of the sea.

489
00:51:30,708 --> 00:51:35,666
How many times I've thought of
giving his life away, but stopped.

490
00:51:37,291 --> 00:51:39,375
Not because he's important

491
00:51:40,666 --> 00:51:44,083
my banner would
survive without him,

492
00:51:48,708 --> 00:51:54,041
but because he makes me laugh.

493
00:51:54,333 --> 00:51:57,125
And my enemies
need a distraction.

494
00:51:59,083 --> 00:52:00,708
It's hypocrisy,

495
00:52:02,125 --> 00:52:03,476
our lives...

496
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:07,726
All this death and
sacrifice from lesser men

497
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:09,916
just to ensure some
victory in our names...

498
00:52:10,958 --> 00:52:16,958
Do you remember what the
Anjin said on the day we met,

499
00:52:17,125 --> 00:52:23,125
when I told him his
fight was pointless?

500
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:27,166
"Unless I win."

501
00:52:28,625 --> 00:52:34,250
If you win, anything
is possible.

502
00:52:36,208 --> 00:52:39,500
Even Shōgun.

503
00:52:42,541 --> 00:52:45,166
It's what you've always
wanted, isn't it?

504
00:52:46,416 --> 00:52:51,166
You're no better than us,
in your secret heart...

505
00:52:52,666 --> 00:52:54,208
Tell me the truth.

506
00:52:54,958 --> 00:52:56,750
I'll take it to my grave.

507
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:15,916
Why tell a dead man the future?

508
00:53:55,458 --> 00:53:59,375
Are you to row me
to my convent...?

509
00:54:00,958 --> 00:54:03,726
Fuji-<i>sama,</i> you've
served me all this time.

510
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:06,791
Please just allow me
this one final gesture.

511
00:54:07,958 --> 00:54:08,958
Look.

512
00:54:15,875 --> 00:54:16,875
Come.

513
00:54:17,458 --> 00:54:18,458
To sea.

514
00:54:19,791 --> 00:54:21,083
Last thing I ask.

515
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:29,226
I've always been of the mind
that a soul committed to the deep

516
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:35,250
is a soul who, in some way,
lives on forever within it.

517
00:54:36,916 --> 00:54:38,291
Understand?

518
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:45,875
Together... forever.

519
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:40,291
Together forever.

520
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:26,083
Let your hands be
the last to hold her.

521
00:56:50,083 --> 00:56:51,083
Raise the ropes!

522
00:56:51,416 --> 00:56:52,976
Hoist the lines.

523
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,851
I know you're tired, but tide's
come up some, so we'll try again.

524
00:56:55,875 --> 00:56:57,500
There you go.

525
00:56:57,708 --> 00:56:58,708
Wait for my cue.

526
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:00,416
Pull!

527
00:57:11,958 --> 00:57:14,101
Oh. We're pissing in the wind.

528
00:57:14,125 --> 00:57:17,166
We need more water. Uh,
tell them they can rest.

529
00:57:17,708 --> 00:57:18,958
Take a break.

530
00:57:45,666 --> 00:57:48,416
Right.

531
00:57:48,916 --> 00:57:51,101
Yes. Yes, this is wonderful.

532
00:57:51,125 --> 00:57:52,559
Raise the ropes!

533
00:57:52,583 --> 00:57:53,726
Raise the lines.

534
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:57,351
Right, you miserable,
sniveling, festering shit rags.

535
00:57:57,375 --> 00:57:59,041
I have a feeling
this is the one.

536
00:57:59,625 --> 00:58:00,602
Listen, everyone...

537
00:58:00,626 --> 00:58:03,708
No. Look, Muraji. Just keep
that between you and I, huh?

538
00:58:07,541 --> 00:58:08,541
Pull!

539
00:58:30,666 --> 00:58:32,125
There she is!

540
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:37,875
I told you she was beautiful! I told
you she'd be worth the business!

541
00:58:53,625 --> 00:58:55,500
That's enough. That's enough.

542
00:58:59,625 --> 00:59:00,833
Good job!

543
00:59:03,333 --> 00:59:04,333
Thank you.

544
00:59:06,875 --> 00:59:08,083
Great work today.

545
00:59:09,291 --> 00:59:10,291
Thank you.

546
00:59:54,125 --> 00:59:55,125
Hmm.
